<center> <i> "Concerned Citizens, Innovative Thinkers, Passionate Learners" </i> </center>

Citizenship is important in a 21st century global economy. We recognise the need to nurture our students to have a sense of belonging to their home country. We want to bring our students up to be rooted to Singapore, to have a strong sense of civic consciousness, to be informed, and to take an active role in bettering the lives of others around them. 

Our vision statement places emphasis on developing innovative thinkers, having the creative, analytical and evaluative capacities that will stand them in good stead for a new world and that will give them a grounded lead to improving the quality of the lives they touch. While we want our students to always strive for excellence, excellence should not be a goal in and of itself and needs to be balanced with a heart of service and a desire to have a positive influence in the community.
