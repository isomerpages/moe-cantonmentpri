<center> <i> To nurture and empower our students to realise their potential and aspirations so <br> as to have a positive impact in the school and the community. </i> </center>

The key words in our mission statement are ‘nurture’ and ‘empower’. While the purpose reflects our vision, the approach we choose, ‘to nurture and empower’ gives ownership, responsibility and autonomy to the child and acknowledges his capacity as an individual in his own right with the potential to achieve. We begin with his aspirations and interests to give him purpose and context for active participation at school and in the community at large.  The mission statement places the teacher as catalyst as it is through his nurturing, guiding and teaching that the child will be empowered.
