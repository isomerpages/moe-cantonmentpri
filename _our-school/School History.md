<h4>The Beginnings of Cantonment Primary - A History and A Journey</h4>
<p>Cantonment Primary is situated in the Tanjong Pagar estate. The name Tanjong
Pagar reflects its origins as a fishing village in the 19th century. It
means "cape of stakes", which was inspired by the presence of kelongs in
the area. In the mid-1980s, Tanjong Pagar became the first area in Singapore
to be gazetted under the government's conservation plan. One of the highlights
of the Tanjong Pagar estate is Cantonment Road, which got its name from
the contingent of Indian sepoys stationed here in 1819. "Cantonment" refers
to the permanent military accommodation established by the sepoys.</p>
<p>There was once a "Cantonment School" established in 1954, which later
merged to become Keppel Primary School in 1984. Cantonment Primary School
started in January 2011 with five classes of Primary One students and one
class each from Primary Two to Four. The Principal, Mrs Soh Mei Foong,
together with an Administrative Manager, three key personnel and nine teachers,
looked into establishing the school.</p>
<p>Cantonment Primary's location at the fringes of the civic district, is
rich opportunity for the school to tap on the rich authentic resources
in the environment to share and impress on our students the country's heritage
and legacies. The Cantonment Primary school premises were built with enhanced
facilities with the Primary Education Review &amp; Implementation (PERI)
recommendations. Those purpose-built facilities provide greater opportunities
for the school to facilitate student-engaged teaching and learning.</p>
<p>When the school first opened, catering to four levels immediately was
not easy for the teachers, however, the staff enthusiastically rose to
the challenge, constructing multiple opportunities for holistic education.
The school song our students heartily belt out has lyrics penned by our
teachers and put to music, composed by a teacher, Mrs Lydia Wong and her
talented husband Mr John Wong. Some of our parent volunteers, led by Mr
Wong Ngai Yin, father of Mrs Charmaine Steup (covering Subject Head / English),
creatively painted beautiful wall murals in the Media Resource Library
(MRL) and Mr Tan Keng Joo, a talented pottery enthusiast and a fellow Principal,
designed and moulded a ceramic wall piece for the school to commemorate
the school's official opening on 5 July 2013.</p>
<p>The tough work of the pioneering years were made lighter by numerous labours
of love lavished by the extended network of being One Cantonment family.</p>
