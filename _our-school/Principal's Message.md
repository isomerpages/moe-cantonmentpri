<p>Stepping into Cantonment as the new principal has been both an exciting
and humbling experience. Over the past month, I have had the privilege
of witnessing the vibrant learning environment our students thrive in.
I take on this role with deep respect for the strong foundation built by
my predecessors and the dedicated educators who have shaped Cantonment
into the school it is today. My goal is to build upon this legacy where
every child feels inspired, challenged, and supported.</p>
<p>Cantonment offers a diverse curriculum that nurtures students holistically.
This reflects our commitment to nurturing passionate learners through student
agency. Children are encouraged to apply critical thinking across subjects
and collaborate to solve real-world challenges. Their confidence grows
as they share their perspectives with peers, teachers, and parents during
learning festivals like the Celebration of Thinking. They also have opportunities
to share their learning experiences at school assemblies which allow them
to take ownership of their growth and inspire their peers.</p>
<p>The students at Cantonment thrive under the unwavering dedication of our
staff who cultivate a safe and positive learning environment—one where
every child is empowered to explore and develop their unique strengths
and interests.</p>
<p>At its heart, education is about preparing young minds not just for academic
success but for life itself. I firmly believe that every child can learn
and wants to learn. Our role as educators is to nurture this curiosity
and provide the support for each student to reach their fullest potential.</p>
<p>I shared this at our Parents’ Briefing. This journey of growth reminds
me of the transformation of a butterfly. A caterpillar must navigate struggle
and change within its chrysalis before emerging with wings to soar. Likewise,
our students are on their own paths of transformation—learning, evolving,
and discovering their unique strengths. As educators and parents, our role
is to support them through this journey, providing the right challenges
and encouragement so they can take flight with confidence.</p>
<p>I invite you to explore our school’s website and Facebook page for updates
and to learn more about our programmes. I look forward to embarking on
this journey with the dedication of our teachers and the partnership of
our parents.</p>
<p>In Partnership with You,
<br>Ms Grace Foo
<br>Principal</p>
