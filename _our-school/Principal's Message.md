<p>I feel a sense of hope and excitement as I watch our new Primary One students
walk through our gates with their parents. I'm reminded that what we do
here isn't just about the six years they'll spend with us. It's about the
foundations we lay for the lives beyond our gates.</p>
<p>Let me share a learning moment with you.</p>
<p>I was watching our students during one of our STEM Playground sessions
where they were trying to build little boats powered by chemical reactions.
What struck me wasn't when their boats worked perfectly. It was what happened
when they didn't. Instead of giving up, these students started moving their
straw exhausts around, chatting with their friends about new ideas and
trying different approaches. I saw frustration but also excitement and
teamwork. Most importantly, they were not simply learning about science
concepts. They were learning how to think when things do not work, how
to adapt their approach and how to learn <em>with</em> and <em>from</em> others.
In those moments, I caught a glimpse of the kind of education we are intentionally
building at Cantonment.</p>
<p>The world our children are growing up in today is fundamentally different.
Change is no longer gradual — it is accelerating.</p>
<p>This reality compels us to ask an important question: <em>What kind of young people do we want to send into this future?</em>
</p>
<p>Over the past year, through conversations, our teachers reflected on the
experiences they had with the students who have passed their hands.&nbsp;
They believed that our students need to learn differently to prepare them
for the future. The honest and thoughtful envisioning led to our new direction: <strong>Future-Ready Learners. Active Contributors.</strong>
</p>
<p>Future-ready learners are students who are adaptive thinkers and self-directed
learners. They are curious, reflective and able to navigate uncertainty
with confidence. They understand that learning does not end with a worksheet
or a test but continues throughout life.</p>
<p>Active contributors are students who have a strong sense of belonging
and the will to act. They step forward, participate meaningfully and seek
to make a positive difference beyond school and in Singapore. We want our
students to have a mindset of a ‘we first’ society which will strengthen
the Singapore spirit for generations.</p>
<p>This vision guides our decisions from curriculum design and pedagogy to
how we shape learning spaces, establish routines and support students day
by day.</p>
<p>Beyond the regular curriculum, students develop adaptive thinking through
our Applied Learning Programme, <em>The Thinking Curriculum</em>. They are
explicitly taught thinking routines and provided with tools to help them
analyse, refine and extend their ideas.</p>
<p>We also place a strong emphasis on developing self-directed learners.
Student-led assemblies, our weekly <em>CCA Chronicles</em> and platforms
such as <em>Gems Jam</em> allow students to take initiative, share their
learning and reflect on how they live out our school values. These opportunities
help students build confidence and ownership of their learning journey.</p>
<p>Belonging is at the heart of contribution. Through our circle time and
one-to-one check-ins, we intentionally create a caring environment where
every child feels heard and valued. Children who feel they belong are children
who care. And children who care are children who act.</p>
<p>We have also refreshed our school song to reflect this renewed sense of
who we are and where we're going.</p>
<p>We invite all parents and stakeholders to partner us in bringing our vision
to live. Together with the dedication of our staff, I believe that every
child will develop their unique strengths and interests.</p>
<p>Feel free to also explore our school’s website and Facebook page for updates
and to learn more about our programmes. I look forward to embarking on
this educational journey with the committed staff of Cantonment and with
the strong partnership of our parents and stakeholders.</p>
<p>In Partnership With You,
<br>Ms Grace Foo
<br>Principal</p>
