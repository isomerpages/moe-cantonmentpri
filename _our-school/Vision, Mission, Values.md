<h3>Vision</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Future-Ready Leaders. Active Contributors.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In today's rapidly evolving world, cultivating future-ready learners has
become essential for navigating uncertainty and embracing change. These
learners possess the adaptability to thrive in dynamic environments, demonstrating
the qualities of adaptive thinkers who can approach challenges with creativity
and resilience. When students develop self-directedness, they become empowered
to take ownership of their learning journey, continuously acquiring new
skills and knowledge that prepare them for an unpredictable future. This
foundation of lifelong learning ensures they remain relevant and capable
contributors to society, regardless of how industries and technologies
transform around them.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Equally important is fostering active contributors who embody the spirit
of a "we first” Singapore, where collective progress takes precedence over
individual gain. Students who cultivate a strong sense of belonging to
both their school community and Singapore develop the resilience necessary
to drive positive change. This belonging, coupled with the will to act,
transforms them from passive observers into engaged contributors who actively
participate in building a better future for all.</p>
<h3>Mission</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>To nurture and empower our students to realise their potential and aspirations so as to have a positive impact in the school and the community.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The key words in our mission statement are ‘nurture’ and ‘empower’. While
the purpose reflects our vision, the approach we choose, ‘to nurture and
empower’ gives ownership, responsibility and autonomy to the child and
acknowledges his capacity as an individual in his own right with the potential
to achieve. We begin with his aspirations and interests to give him purpose
and context for active participation at school and in the community at
large. &nbsp;The mission statement places the teacher as catalyst as it
is through his nurturing, guiding and teaching that the child will be empowered.</p>
<h3>Logo</h3>

<p>The school crest draws inspiration from an old Chinese proverb ‘十年树木,
百年树人’, which means ‘it takes ten years to plant a tree but a hundred years
to nurture and mould the character of a person.’ The school crest represents
education as evergreen and fruit bearing. Education continually nurtures
and moulds the character of a person to be deeply rooted in good values
and through a process of love and patience. The school crest has rounded
symbols portraying education as holistic. Visually, the rounded symbols
look like people in motion and depict the school as a dynamic place with
a vibrant culture where interaction and growth are evident.</p>
<p>There are three colours in the school crest, each with significant meaning.
Blue conveys strength and steadfastness; good traits that we seek to nurture
in our students. Green represents growth and harmony and signifies how
the staff and students will work harmoniously to grow together. Orange
portrays vibrancy, dynamism and warmth and the colour is symbolic of the
culture that Cantonment aspires to build.</p>
