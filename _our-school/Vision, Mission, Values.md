### Vision 

<center> <i> Concerned Citizens, Innovative Thinkers, Passionate Learners </i> </center>

Citizenship is important in a 21st century global economy. We recognise the need to nurture our students to have a sense of belonging to their home country. We want to bring our students up to be rooted to Singapore, to have a strong sense of civic consciousness, to be informed, and to take an active role in bettering the lives of others around them. 

Our vision statement places emphasis on developing innovative thinkers, having the creative, analytical and evaluative capacities that will stand them in good stead for a new world and that will give them a grounded lead to improving the quality of the lives they touch. While we want our students to always strive for excellence, excellence should not be a goal in and of itself and needs to be balanced with a heart of service and a desire to have a positive influence in the community.

### Mission
<center> <i> To nurture and empower our students to realise their potential and aspirations so <br> as to have a positive impact in the school and the community. </i> </center>

The key words in our mission statement are ‘nurture’ and ‘empower’. While the purpose reflects our vision, the approach we choose, ‘to nurture and empower’ gives ownership, responsibility and autonomy to the child and acknowledges his capacity as an individual in his own right with the potential to achieve. We begin with his aspirations and interests to give him purpose and context for active participation at school and in the community at large.  The mission statement places the teacher as catalyst as it is through his nurturing, guiding and teaching that the child will be empowered.

The school crest draws inspiration from an old Chinese proverb ‘十年树木, 百年树人’, which means ‘it takes ten years to plant a tree but a hundred years to nurture and mould the character of a person.’ The school crest represents education as evergreen and fruit bearing. Education continually nurtures and moulds the character of a person to be deeply rooted in good values and through a process of love and patience. The school crest has rounded symbols portraying education as holistic. Visually, the rounded symbols look like people in motion and depict the school as a dynamic place with a vibrant culture where interaction and growth are evident.  
  
There are three colours in the school crest, each with significant meaning. Blue conveys strength and steadfastness; good traits that we seek to nurture in our students. Green represents growth and harmony and signifies how the staff and students will work harmoniously to grow together. Orange portrays vibrancy, dynamism and warmth and the colour is symbolic of the culture that Cantonment aspires to build.
