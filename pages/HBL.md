### HBL
Dear Parents/Guardians,  

In guiding your children in the Home-Based Learning, please take note of the following.

1) Refer to the HBL timetable that has been given to your child for the HBL lessons he/she will be going through from 21 to 22 July.

2) The subjects that are highlighted in your child’s HBL timetable refer to lessons that are conducted online in the Student Learning Space (SLS).
  
3) For the subjects that are reflected in your child’s timetable for the day of HBL, refer to the respective subject overview on the right for details. Note that your child is only required to complete the work for the subjects reflected in his/her timetable for the day of HBL.
