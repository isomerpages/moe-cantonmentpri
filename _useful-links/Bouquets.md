<p><strong>Mr Josh Wong</strong>
<br>Mr Wong is very kind and supportive to the children‚Äôs learning and development.
My child is happy learning in the classroom and is always motivated to
go to school.</p>
<p><strong>Mr Chan and Ms Koh<br></strong>I would like to thank both the
teachers for going extra mile to ensure my daughter‚Äôs needs are not neglected.
They are always concern and caring towards her. My daughter is super thankful
and happy to go to school. Thank you once again.</p>
<p><strong>Miss Karen John and Mrs Joleen Teo</strong>
<br>I would like to express my sincere appreciation for the effort and dedication
you have shown in teaching my child both Math and English. I have seen
noticeable progress in his understanding, confidence, and enthusiasm for
learning. Your patience, encouragement, and clear way of explaining concepts
have truly made a difference.</p>
<p>It is evident that you not only teach the subjects well, but also inspire
curiosity and a positive attitude toward learning. Thank you for your commitment
and the supportive environment you create for your students.</p>
<p><strong>Ms Karen John, Mrs Joleen Teo and Ms Seah </strong>

<p><strong>Ms Prema (non-teaching staff)</strong>
<br>Whenever I fall down and scrape my knee or injure myself, I go to the
general office to ask someone to tend to my wound. Every time I step in
the general office, I would always be greeted by the warm smile on Ms Prema‚Äôs
face. She would express empathy and would help me wash the wound and then
put a plaster on my injury. She is really like a bee, busy and hardworking,
and like the unassuming candle, lighting up the whole school with her smiles
and her empathetic actions. She is a positive influence and role model
for the whole school to imitate.</p>

<p><strong>Mrs Tan Guat Hwa</strong>
<br>Mrs Tan has a gentle, calm and loving nature that keeps the class on order
and attentive. She is careful and gracious in her speech, making sure she
doesn‚Äôt embarrass and put down individuals. Though Math is a subject that
bores me, Mrs Tan helps make Math fun by giving us each a point system.
This point system is useful as it not only helps to motivate us to be hardworking,
but it also helps us develop integrity. She does not record the points
for us, instead, she lets us record it ourselves. This gives us the opportunity
to be honest. We can just write down thousands of thousands of points on
our exercise book and just get stationaries and snacks without working
for it. Though she does not go to investigate to find out if we are being
scheming, she chooses to give us the benefit of the doubt. At the same
time, she teaches us the concept so well that we do not need tuition to
get AL1 for math. She really is a good math and character ‚Äútutor‚Äù.</p>
<p><strong>Teachers from P2 In</strong>
<br>Thank you, teachers from P2 Integrity, especially the form teachers who
put in a lot of effort by guiding the students, especially my daughter!
She gained a bit more confidence in her public speaking, and it wouldn't
have been possible without your encouragement! So a big THANK YOU!</p>

<p><strong>Ms Jon</strong>
<br>Ms Jon has been very caring and motivating my daughter at all the milestones
for her maths. She keep encouraging her and she is super happy and always
looking forward to her maths lesson. Thank you for also looking out for
her as well to ensure she is well settled in class.</p>
<p><strong>Mr Nur</strong>

to his lessons and has been able to cope well with his teachings. Thank
you for also always looking out for her to ensure she is doing well in

<p><strong>All 2 Integrity Teachers</strong>
<br>Happy Teacher‚Äôs Day to all of you! Thank you very much for your dedication
and support in teaching my child. He transitioned from an international
school in P1, having relocated from overseas, and is now in P2. He has
never had any issues integrating into CPS since day one and has smoothly
transitioned between schools and countries. You have prepared my child
to be resilient, developing a great attitude towards learning, and showing
perseverance and improvement in his academics. We are truly grateful for
him being at CPS, where he genuinely feels happy and enjoys learning every
single subject that the school offers, which is the most critical factor
for us. This could not have been achieved without all the teachers of 2
Integrity. As the saying goes, it takes a village to raise a child ‚Äì this
couldn‚Äôt be more accurate. I would also like to give a big shout-out to
the form teachers of 2 Integrity, Miss Karen John and Mrs Joleen Teo. Thank
you for supporting our child not just academically, but also in his overall
well-being and character development, and for going the extra mile in your
communication with us parents.</p>
<p>Wishing you all a wonderful and restful Teacher‚Äôs Day. üíê</p>

done!</p>
<p><strong>Mrs Ramesh</strong>
