My child is happy learning in the classroom and is always motivated to
go to school.</p>
<p><strong>Mr Chan and Ms Koh<br></strong>I would like to thank both the

They are always concern and caring towards her. My daughter is super thankful
and happy to go to school. Thank you once again.</p>
<p><strong>Miss Karen John and Mrs Joleen Teo</strong>
<br>I would like to express my sincere appreciation for the effort and dedication
you have shown in teaching my child both Math and English. I have seen
noticeable progress in his understanding, confidence, and enthusiasm for
learning. Your patience, encouragement, and clear way of explaining concepts
have truly made a difference.</p>
<p>It is evident that you not only teach the subjects well, but also inspire
curiosity and a positive attitude toward learning. Thank you for your commitment
and the supportive environment you create for your students.</p>

<p><strong>Ms Prema (non-teaching staff)</strong>
<br>Whenever I fall down and scrape my knee or injure myself, I go to the
general office to ask someone to tend to my wound. Every time I step in
the general office, I would always be greeted by the warm smile on Ms Prema‚Äôs
face. She would express empathy and would help me wash the wound and then
put a plaster on my injury. She is really like a bee, busy and hardworking,
and like the unassuming candle, lighting up the whole school with her smiles
and her empathetic actions. She is a positive influence and role model
for the whole school to imitate.</p>

<p><strong>Mrs Tan Guat Hwa</strong>
<br>Mrs Tan has a gentle, calm and loving nature that keeps the class on order
and attentive. She is careful and gracious in her speech, making sure she
doesn‚Äôt embarrass and put down individuals. Though Math is a subject that
bores me, Mrs Tan helps make Math fun by giving us each a point system.
This point system is useful as it not only helps to motivate us to be hardworking,
but it also helps us develop integrity. She does not record the points
for us, instead, she lets us record it ourselves. This gives us the opportunity
to be honest. We can just write down thousands of thousands of points on
our exercise book and just get stationaries and snacks without working
for it. Though she does not go to investigate to find out if we are being
scheming, she chooses to give us the benefit of the doubt. At the same
time, she teaches us the concept so well that we do not need tuition to
get AL1 for math. She really is a good math and character ‚Äútutor‚Äù.</p>
<p><strong>Teachers from P2 In</strong>
<br>Thank you, teachers from P2 Integrity, especially the form teachers who
put in a lot of effort by guiding the students, especially my daughter!
She gained a bit more confidence in her public speaking, and it wouldn't
have been possible without your encouragement! So a big THANK YOU!</p>
<p><strong>Mdm Gloria Tan</strong>
<br>Madam Tan is a kind and caring educator. My son enjoys school and learning!</p>
<p><strong>Mdm Toh</strong>
<br>Thank you for taking great care of the kids and staying in touch to communicate
and share on how things can be better. I appreciate that you worked with
us to develop certain skills in my son, understood him and patiently helping
him grow!</p>
<p><strong>Ms Jon</strong>
<br>Ms Jon has been very caring and motivating my daughter at all the milestones
for her maths. She keep encouraging her and she is super happy and always
looking forward to her maths lesson. Thank you for also looking out for
her as well to ensure she is well settled in class.</p>
<p><strong>Mr Nur</strong>
<br>Mr Nur is a very caring and nurturing teacher. My daughter looks forward
to his lessons and has been able to cope well with his teachings. Thank
you for also always looking out for her to ensure she is doing well in
class.</p>
<p><strong>Teachers in 4HA</strong>
