<p><strong>Mr Mizi, Mrs Rachel Ho, Mr Ameen, Mr Wong, School Counsellor Ms Ooi and Principal Ms Foo</strong>
<br>Happy Teacher’s Day! 💐</p>
<p>I’m so grateful to Mr Mizi, Mrs Rachel Ho, Mr Ameen, Mr Wong, the counsellor,
the Principal and all teachers who have cared for my son. Your love, patience,
concern and empathy go far beyond teaching—you nurture the students’ well-being
with such sincerity. I’m truly touched and can’t thank you enough for all
you do. 🙏❤️</p>
<p>Please know that your impact makes a lasting difference in their lives.</p>
<p><strong>Mr Josh Wong</strong>
<br>Mr Wong is very kind and supportive to the children’s learning and development.
My child is happy learning in the classroom and is always motivated to
go to school.</p>
<p><strong>Mr Chan and Ms Koh<br></strong>I would like to thank both the
teachers for going extra mile to ensure my daughter’s needs are not neglected.
They are always concern and caring towards her. My daughter is super thankful
and happy to go to school. Thank you once again.</p>
<p><strong>Miss Karen John and Mrs Joleen Teo</strong>
<br>I would like to express my sincere appreciation for the effort and dedication
you have shown in teaching my child both Math and English. I have seen
noticeable progress in his understanding, confidence, and enthusiasm for
learning. Your patience, encouragement, and clear way of explaining concepts
have truly made a difference.</p>
<p>It is evident that you not only teach the subjects well, but also inspire
curiosity and a positive attitude toward learning. Thank you for your commitment
and the supportive environment you create for your students.</p>
<p><strong>Ms Karen John, Mrs Joleen Teo and Ms Seah </strong>
<br>Thank you for the countless hours you spend preparing engaging lessons.
We are so grateful for your partnership in our child's education and You
are a truly inspirational educator.😊</p>
<p><strong>Cikgu Zulhilmi</strong>
<br>Thank you for the countless hours you spend preparing engaging lessons.
We are so grateful for your partnership in our child's education and You

<p><strong>Ms Prema (non-teaching staff)</strong>
<br>Whenever I fall down and scrape my knee or injure myself, I go to the
general office to ask someone to tend to my wound. Every time I step in
the general office, I would always be greeted by the warm smile on Ms Prema’s
face. She would express empathy and would help me wash the wound and then
put a plaster on my injury. She is really like a bee, busy and hardworking,
and like the unassuming candle, lighting up the whole school with her smiles
and her empathetic actions. She is a positive influence and role model
for the whole school to imitate.</p>
<p><strong>Mrs Tan Guat Hwa</strong>
<br>Mrs Tan has a gentle, calm and loving nature that keeps the class on order
and attentive. She is careful and gracious in her speech, making sure she
doesn’t embarrass and put down individuals. Though Math is a subject that
bores me, Mrs Tan helps make Math fun by giving us each a point system.
This point system is useful as it not only helps to motivate us to be hardworking,
but it also helps us develop integrity. She does not record the points
for us, instead, she lets us record it ourselves. This gives us the opportunity
to be honest. We can just write down thousands of thousands of points on
our exercise book and just get stationaries and snacks without working
for it. Though she does not go to investigate to find out if we are being
scheming, she chooses to give us the benefit of the doubt. At the same
time, she teaches us the concept so well that we do not need tuition to
get AL1 for math. She really is a good math and character “tutor”.</p>
<p><strong>Teachers from P2 In</strong>
<br>Thank you, teachers from P2 Integrity, especially the form teachers who
put in a lot of effort by guiding the students, especially my daughter!
She gained a bit more confidence in her public speaking, and it wouldn't
have been possible without your encouragement! So a big THANK YOU!</p>
<p><strong>Mdm Gloria Tan</strong>
<br>Madam Tan is a kind and caring educator. My son enjoys school and learning!</p>

<p><strong>Ms Jon</strong>
<br>Ms Jon has been very caring and motivating my daughter at all the milestones
for her maths. She keep encouraging her and she is super happy and always
looking forward to her maths lesson. Thank you for also looking out for
her as well to ensure she is well settled in class.</p>
<p><strong>Mr Nur</strong>
<br>Mr Nur is a very caring and nurturing teacher. My daughter looks forward
to his lessons and has been able to cope well with his teachings. Thank
you for also always looking out for her to ensure she is doing well in

<p><strong>All 2 Integrity Teachers</strong>
<br>Happy Teacher’s Day to all of you! Thank you very much for your dedication
and support in teaching my child. He transitioned from an international
school in P1, having relocated from overseas, and is now in P2. He has
never had any issues integrating into CPS since day one and has smoothly
transitioned between schools and countries. You have prepared my child
to be resilient, developing a great attitude towards learning, and showing
perseverance and improvement in his academics. We are truly grateful for
him being at CPS, where he genuinely feels happy and enjoys learning every
single subject that the school offers, which is the most critical factor
for us. This could not have been achieved without all the teachers of 2
Integrity. As the saying goes, it takes a village to raise a child – this
couldn’t be more accurate. I would also like to give a big shout-out to
the form teachers of 2 Integrity, Miss Karen John and Mrs Joleen Teo. Thank
you for supporting our child not just academically, but also in his overall
well-being and character development, and for going the extra mile in your
communication with us parents.</p>
<p>Wishing you all a wonderful and restful Teacher’s Day. 💐</p>
<p><strong>Mrs Han and All teachers </strong>

all of your presence in my son’s life! Thank you for being there for him
for most parts of his days. Your dedication and effort plays a huge role
in his learning. We appreciate deeply and thankful for all that you’ve
done!</p>
<p><strong>Mrs Ramesh</strong>
<br>Always hear from my son when he's home how Mrs Ramesh tells them words
of wisdom. I believe in these honing years, every word of wisdom stick
with them through their lives, and I'm thankful to her for it!</p>
<p><strong>Mr Alan</strong>
<br>Happy Teacher’s Day!</p>

<p><strong>Ms Rachel Ho</strong>
<br>I am writing to express my sincere gratitude for the wonderful impact

full of stories about the games he played. Thank you for fostering such
a positive, inclusive and active environment. Your passion for teaching

<p><strong>Cikgu Nur Muhammad </strong>

<p><strong>Mr Seah Tiong Boon</strong>
<br>Thank you for making your Math lessons fun &amp; enjoyable! Also thank
you for your patience and care for the students!</p>
<p><strong>Mrs Jasmine Han and Mrs Donica Goh</strong>
<br>I want to sincerely thank you for the important role you played in my
son’s early years of primary school. When he first started, he was very
shy and not very confident. With your gentle encouragement and kind understanding,
he slowly blossomed—becoming more expressive, confident, and comfortable
in school.</p>
<p>Having a form teacher like you in the lower primary years makes such a
huge difference. You gave him not just knowledge, but also the foundation
of feeling safe, supported, and happy in class. This has helped prepare
him so well for the middle primary years, and I am deeply grateful for
the positive start you have given him.</p>
<p><strong>Mr Tiong Boon Seah</strong>
<br>Thank you for making science such a fun and enjoyable subject! Your energy,
humor, and passion for teaching bring the lessons to life, and it’s clear
how much the children look forward to your classes. The children are very
lucky to have a teacher like you, who makes learning both exciting and
memorable.</p>
<p><strong>Mdm Toh &amp; Mdm Sujatha</strong>
<br>Thank you to both teachers for their care and patience with the students!
We also appreciate how well the parents are kept informed about events,
celebrations, and field trips. Truly grateful!</p>
<p><strong>Mr Joshua Goh</strong>
<br>Thank you for being such a wonderful teacher to my son over the past five
years. Your kindness, guidance, and steady support have made such a difference
in his journey. Whether in class or in PE, you’ve created an environment
where learning is not only meaningful but also truly enjoyable.</p>

confidence, resilience, and joy in learning.</p>

<br>3 years ago, both teachers played a crucial role in making the child's

created a supportive environment where she felt heard and valued. They
truly understood that even the smallest concerns mattered, always offering
a caring ear to listen and provide reassurance.</p>
