The Ministry of Education provides financial assistance to Singaporean students from our Government and Government-Aided Schools who need financial assistance for their studies.
[Official Website](https://www.moe.gov.sg/financial-matters/financial-assistance) <br>

**Who is eligible**

Students who:
*   Are Singapore Citizens.
*   Attend government or government-aided schools.
*   Have a monthly gross household income of $3,000 or less, or a monthly per capita income of $750 or less.

Under the MSF-MOE collaboration, ComCare recipients with ComCare assistance ending in the last quarter of 2023, or later need not submit the application for MOE FAS as MOE FAS will be auto-granted to ComCare beneficiaries. School will inform the eligible parents.

**How to apply**
* [Apply online](https://go.gov.sg/moe-efas)
* On Parent Gateway - Using the e-FAS form (under Services tab – Financial Assistance).
* Alternatively, you can [download](/files/FAS/moe fas application form.pdf) the MOE FAS application form attached or collect a copy at school. Submit the completed form directly to the school.

Note: If you have children in different government or government-aided schools, you just need to submit 1 application form to any of their schools. The school that receives the application form will inform you of the outcome.

**Additional Financial Help**

*   If you require further financial assistance beyond the MOE FAS, you can approach your child’s school to find out more about their school-based financial assistance. Your request will be evaluated by the school on a case-by-case basis.
