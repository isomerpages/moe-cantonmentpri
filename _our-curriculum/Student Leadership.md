<p>At Cantonment Primary School (CPS), we believe every child has the potential
to lead and inspire. Our Student Leadership Development (SLD) programme
is thoughtfully designed to nurture this potential, equipping our Prefects,
Peer Support Leaders (PSL) and various class leadership roles with the
values, mindset, and skills to lead with purpose, compassion, and resilience.</p>

<p><strong>Why Student Leadership Matters in a Primary School</strong>
</p>
<p>Leadership is not just a title; it is a mindset and skillset that can
be cultivated from a young age. At CPS, we recognise that primary school
is the ideal time to begin nurturing leadership qualities. Students at
this age are naturally curious, eager to connect with others, and quick
to absorb values through guided experiences.</p>
<p>Our SLD programme develops the whole child, helping them:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Build confidence and self-awareness</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Embrace responsibility and ownership</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Practice collaboration and empathy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Learn to think critically and communicate respectfully</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>By focusing on <strong>Self-Leadership, Team Leadership, and Thought Leadership</strong>,
we provide structured opportunities for students to lead themselves, work
with others, and generate ideas that drive positive change. These experiences
leave a lasting impact that extends beyond their time at CPS.</p>
