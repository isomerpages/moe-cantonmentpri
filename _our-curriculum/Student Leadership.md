<p>At Cantonment Primary School (CPS), we believe every child has the potential
to lead and inspire. Our Student Leadership Development (SLD) programme
is thoughtfully designed to nurture this potential, equipping our Prefects,
Peer Support Leaders (PSL) and various class leadership roles with the
values, mindset, and skills to lead with purpose, compassion, and resilience.</p>

<h4><strong>Why Student Leadership Matters in a Primary School</strong></h4>
<p>Leadership is not just a title; it is a mindset and skillset that can
be cultivated from a young age. At CPS, we recognise that primary school
is the ideal time to begin nurturing leadership qualities. Students at
this age are naturally curious, eager to connect with others, and quick
to absorb values through guided experiences.</p>
<p>Our SLD programme develops the whole child, helping them:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Build confidence and self-awareness</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Embrace responsibility and ownership</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Practice collaboration and empathy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Learn to think critically and communicate respectfully</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>By focusing on <strong>Self-Leadership, Team Leadership, and Thought Leadership</strong>,
we provide structured opportunities for students to lead themselves, work
with others, and generate ideas that drive positive change. These experiences
leave a lasting impact that extends beyond their time at CPS.</p>

<h4><strong>Tiers of Leadership Appointment in CPS</strong></h4>
<p>At CPS, student leadership opportunities are inclusive and structured
across three tiers:</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Student Leadership/Student_Leadership4.png">
</div>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Tier 1:</strong>  <strong>All Students</strong> – Every student is
encouraged to practise self-leadership through daily routines, character
education, and values-based experiences in the classroom.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Tier 2:</strong>  <strong>Class Leadership Roles</strong> – Students
may be appointed as class monitors, subject representatives, or environment
champions to practise team leadership in their class environment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Tier 3:</strong>  <strong>Prefects, Peer Support Leaders (PSLs), and CCA Leaders</strong> –
Selected students are given wider leadership responsibilities across the
school, with opportunities to influence the student body, support wellbeing
initiatives, and lead school-wide events.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Our training model is carefully aligned to the three leadership dimensions
to ensure purposeful development at each stage:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">

<p><strong>Self-Leadership:</strong> Students are introduced to the principles
of personal responsibility, growth mindset, and self-discipline through
the 'Leader in Me' programme.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Team Leadership:</strong> Class leaders, Prefects, and PSLs participate
in role-specific training sessions that focus on communication, peer support,
and collaborative problem-solving.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Thought Leadership:</strong> The Prefect and PSL Executive Committees
engage in focus group discussions with teachers, conceptualise and execute
key school events, and advocate for student voice and improvement initiatives.</p>
</li>
</ul>
