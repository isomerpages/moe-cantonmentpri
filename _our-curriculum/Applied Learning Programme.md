<h3>Thinking@CPS Curriculum</h3>
<h4>Vision</h4>
<p>Concerned Citizens, Innovative Thinkers, Passionate Learners</p>
<p><strong>Overview</strong> 
<br>The Thinking Curriculum at CPS seeks to inculcate in students the attitudes,
skills, and dispositions to approach challenges with a positive, inquiring
and problem-solving mindset.</p>
<p>We believe that when students are equipped with thinking skills and provided
with opportunities to practise these thinking skills, they will develop
the thinking dispositions needed to tackle challenges they face in the
future.</p>
<p>With regular practice, thinking routines become natural habits of mind.
They provide structured approaches that can be applied across different
contexts and subjects, helping develop consistent analytical and critical
thinking skills. Thinking routines support Active Learning. Rather than
passive reception of information, thinking routines engage learners actively
in constructing understanding. They prompt questions, connections, and
deeper exploration of ideas.</p>
<p>Thinking skills and dispositions are practiced through four levels:</p>
<p><strong><u>Level 1 – Classroom pedagogy and instruction</u></strong>
<br>Every department in the school infuses thinking routines into their curriculum
to help students make their thinking visible during idea exploration, idea
organisation and idea synthesis.</p>
<p>Routines such as ‘See-Think-Wonder’, ‘Claim-Support-Question’, ‘Step-Inside’
and ‘Think-Puzlle-Explore’ help students become more aware of their own
thinking processes, fostering metacognitive skills that are crucial for
deeper learning and problem-solving. They encourage reflection on how we
think, not just what we think.</p>
