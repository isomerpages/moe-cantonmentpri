Thinking@CPS Curriculum

### Vision
Concerned Citizens, Innovative Thinkers, Passionate Learners

### Signature Programmes

**Overview** <br>
The Thinking Curriculum at CPS seeks to inculcate in students the attitudes, skills, and dispositions to approach challenges with a positive, inquiring and problem-solving mindset.

We believe that when students are equipped with thinking skills and provided with opportunities to practice these thinking skills, they will develop the thinking dispositions needed to tackle challenges they face in the future.

Through the Thinking Programme, our students are equipped with the attitudes, skills, and dispositions to become Concerned Citizens, Innovative Thinkers and Passionate Learners. 

Thinking skills and dispositions are practiced through four levels:

<u><strong> Level 1 – Classroom pedagogy and instruction </strong></u><br>
Every department in the school infuses thinking routines into their curriculum to help students make their thinking visible during idea exploration, idea organisation and idea synthesis.
