### Signature Programmes

**Lower Primary Games Day (Primary 1 to 3)** <br>
The annual Lower Primary Games Day has always been the highlight for our Primary 1 to 3 students. This is a time where every student gets the opportunity to represent his/her class to compete with other classes in various games and sports.

The stations, played in a relay style, are designed by the Physical Education (PE) department. Each station comprises physical skills taught during PE lessons, which is in alignment to the PE syllabus. Students will also be able to appreciate social and emotional bonds with their classmates as they take turns to play the games and cheer them on. In addition, they will also learn the school values such as resilience as they learn from the successes and failures in the game practices and actual competitions.

The current situation may not have allowed for physical inter-class competitions to take place, but this does not dampen the spirit of excellence in our students. They compete within their own classes, giving their best in the skills required in the games. Most importantly, students have fun and bond as a class!

The current situation may not have allowed for physical competitions to take place, but this did not dampen the spirit of excellence in our students. They competed in their own classrooms, giving their best in the skills required in the game given the constraints. Most importantly, they had fun as a class!
