<h4>PE</h4>
<p>The aim of Physical Education in our school is to develop physically competent
and confident individuals who enjoy a lifetime of active and healthy living
safely and responsibly. Anchored on the <em>National Physical Education Curriculum Framework</em>,
our PE programme focuses on the development of fundamental movement skills,
games concepts, and the acquisition of positive values. Through meaningful
and purposeful learning experiences, students build physical literacy,
cultivate teamwork and resilience, and develop the habits of mind for lifelong
health and well-being.</p>

<h4>Signature Programmes</h4>
<p><strong>Lower Primary Games Day (Primary 1 to 3)</strong>
</p>
<p>Held in conjunction with our National Day Celebrations, the annual Lower
Primary Games Day is a much-anticipated highlight for our Primary 1 to
3 students. Designed by the PE department and assisted by the Form Teachers
and Parent Volunteers, the relay-style game stations are based on fundamental
movement skills and concepts taught during PE lessons, in alignment with
the PE syllabus. The event provides an inclusive platform for every student
to participate, fostering physical competence, confidence, and enjoyment.
As students take turns to play and cheer on their classmates, they build
social-emotional bonds, practise responsible decision-making, and demonstrate
school values such as resilience and respect. More than just a competition,
the Games Day promotes class spirit, teamwork, and a joy for active living.</p>

<p><strong>Upper Primary Games Day (Primary 4 to 6)</strong>
</p>
<p>Our Upper Primary Games Day is a highly anticipated event that provides
a dynamic platform for Primary 4 to 6 students during Children’s Day Celebrations.
Aligned with the 2024 PE syllabus, students apply movement skills, tactics,
and concepts from the learning areas of net-barrier games, territorial-invasion
games, and striking/fielding games through inter-class competitions. Primary
6 students take part in blended, inclusive games that emphasise collaboration,
adaptability, and shared success. Through this experience, students not
only demonstrate physical competencies and teamwork, but also live out
the Olympic values of <em>Citius, Altius, Fortius</em> — striving to be faster,
aim higher, and grow stronger together. The event fosters resilience, fair
play, and camaraderie, deepening students’ joy in movement and their appreciation
of what it means to be part of a sporting community.</p>

<p><strong>SwimSafer 2.0 Programme (Primary 3)</strong>
</p>
<p>As part of our Physical Education curriculum, all Primary 3 students participate
in the SwimSafer programme — a national water safety initiative aimed at
equipping students with essential swimming and water survival skills. Through
progressive learning stages conducted by certified instructors, students
build water confidence, develop stroke techniques, and learn how to stay
safe in and around water. This experience not only promotes physical competence
and safety awareness, but also nurtures resilience and responsible decision-making,
in alignment with the goals of the PE syllabus.</p>
