### Signature Programmes

<u><strong> Lower Primary Games Day (Primary 1 to 2) </strong> </u><br>
The annual Lower Primary Games Day has always been the highlight for our Primary 1 to 2 students. This is a time where every student gets the opportunity to represent his/her class to compete with other classes in various games and sports.

The stations, played in a relay style, are designed by the Physical Education (PE) department. Each station comprises physical skills taught during PE lessons, which is in alignment to the PE syllabus. Students will also be able to appreciate social and emotional bonds with their classmates as they take turns to play the games and cheer them on. In addition, they will also demonstrate the school values such as resilience as they learn from the successes and failures in the game practices and actual competitions. Through this annual games day event, it is our hope that that the students have fun and bond as a class!

<u><strong> Upper Primary Games Day (Primary 3 to 6) </strong> </u><br>
The Upper Primary Games Day for our Primary 3 to 5 students is integrated as part of our Children’s Day celebration every year. Whereas for the Primary 6 students, they will have their very own Games Day during post-PSLE. It is an event that our students look forward to as it is an exciting platform for them to showcase and apply the different skills they have learnt in PE lessons through inter-class competitions. The games played at each level are Football (Primary 4), Floorball (Primary 5), and Frisbee (Primary 6), whereby they focus on the use of different equipment learnt in their PE Lessons as well as the application of Games Concepts in the Learning Area of Games and Sports.

While Games Day is a competition itself, it provides ample opportunities for students to work and communicate with one another; build strength and resilience; understand the importance of teamwork and enact the true meaning of sportsmanship, fair play and respect for opponents.

<u><strong> Primary 4 Museum Based Learning (MBL) </strong></u><br>
From 2018, all primary school students will get to visit a museum as part of the refreshed art education syllabus aimed to make learning more authentic and to expose students to Singapore art. The MBL experience is designed to provide both breadth and depth of learning local art as part of all Primary 4 students’ core learning experience in the art curriculum.

The experience comprises pre-, during- and post-visit experiences to National Gallery Singapore where students are involved as artists and audience to create and appreciate art. MBL culminates in a showcase of students’ art expressions that will form part of the collective memory for all Singaporean students. There is a greater focus on visual inquiry skills – observation and interpretation – and reflecting on artwork through activities and discussions facilitated by the education facilitator of the museum.

<u><strong> Primary 5 Camp </strong> </u><br>
The Primary 5 Outdoor Camp is a 3-day programme that is part of MOE’s initiative to provide every primary school child with an outdoor experience to promote the development of social skills, knowledge and values.

The camp serves as a platform for the students to integrate their learning of the various academic subjects through the provision of outdoor experiences. In the camp, students engage in outdoor activities, embrace diversity through social mixing opportunities&nbsp;and develop positive Teacher-Student Relationships via out-of-classroom interactions.

The song composing category is open to the middle and upper primary students to encourage original song composition which promotes the school core values. The inter-class category encourages students to perform as a class. All students are provided with training during Music lessons so that students can uncover their hidden talents.

<u><strong> PAM Fiesta (All levels) </strong></u><br> 
The aim of the PAM Fiesta is to promote the love for the arts and a healthy lifestyle. Every year, the PAM Fiesta, held in the last week of Term 3 brings out the sporty, artistic and musical side of Cantonment students. Students participate in music, art and physical activities. This includes watching performances put up by winners of the Gems Jam during the assembly as well as during the recesses. Art activities such as painting, drawing and craft work are also made available for the students during the recesses. The annual art competition also provides a platform for students to showcase their artistic talents. Physical and health-related activities are carried out during the assembly and recess periods to bring fun and laughter to the children. PAM Fiesta is also a platform where PE projects are displayed for students to appreciate their peers’ work.
