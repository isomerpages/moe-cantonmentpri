<h3>PE</h3>
<p>The aim of Physical Education in our school is to develop physically competent
and confident individuals who enjoy a lifetime of active and healthy living
safely and responsibly. Anchored on the <em>National Physical Education Curriculum Framework</em>,
our PE programme focuses on the development of fundamental movement skills,
games concepts, and the acquisition of positive values. Through meaningful
and purposeful learning experiences, students build physical literacy,
cultivate teamwork and resilience, and develop the habits of mind for lifelong
health and well-being.</p>

<h4>Signature Programmes</h4>
<p><strong>Lower Primary Games Day (Primary 1 to 3)</strong>
</p>
<p>Held in conjunction with our National Day Celebrations, the annual Lower
Primary Games Day is a much-anticipated highlight for our Primary 1 to
3 students. Designed by the PE department and assisted by the Form Teachers
and Parent Volunteers, the relay-style game stations are based on fundamental
movement skills and concepts taught during PE lessons, in alignment with
the PE syllabus. The event provides an inclusive platform for every student
to participate, fostering physical competence, confidence, and enjoyment.
As students take turns to play and cheer on their classmates, they build
social-emotional bonds, practise responsible decision-making, and demonstrate
school values such as resilience and respect. More than just a competition,
the Games Day promotes class spirit, teamwork, and a joy for active living.</p>

<p><strong>Upper Primary Games Day (Primary 4 to 6)</strong>
</p>
<p>Our Upper Primary Games Day is a highly anticipated event that provides
a dynamic platform for Primary 4 to 6 students during Children’s Day Celebrations.
Aligned with the 2024 PE syllabus, students apply movement skills, tactics,
and concepts from the learning areas of net-barrier games, territorial-invasion
games, and striking/fielding games through inter-class competitions. Primary
6 students take part in blended, inclusive games that emphasise collaboration,
adaptability, and shared success. Through this experience, students not
only demonstrate physical competencies and teamwork, but also live out
the Olympic values of <em>Citius, Altius, Fortius</em> — striving to be faster,
aim higher, and grow stronger together. The event fosters resilience, fair
play, and camaraderie, deepening students’ joy in movement and their appreciation
of what it means to be part of a sporting community.</p>

<p><strong>SwimSafer 2.0 Programme (Primary 3)</strong>
</p>
<p>As part of our Physical Education curriculum, all Primary 3 students participate
in the SwimSafer programme — a national water safety initiative aimed at
equipping students with essential swimming and water survival skills. Through
progressive learning stages conducted by certified instructors, students
build water confidence, develop stroke techniques, and learn how to stay
safe in and around water. This experience not only promotes physical competence
and safety awareness, but also nurtures resilience and responsible decision-making,
in alignment with the goals of the PE syllabus.</p>

<p><strong>Outdoor Learning Experience – Trip to our school’s neighbourhood (Primary 4)</strong>
</p>
<p>Our Primary 4 students embark on a day trip to explore the green spaces
around the school, deepening their personal connection with the neighbourhood.
Prior to the trip, they learn how to observe their surroundings safely
and mindfully. On the trip, students apply outdoor skills to discover nature
from different perspectives, building confidence and readiness for future
outdoor experiences, including residential camps in upper primary.</p>

</p>
<p>Our inaugural Combined Schools Camp between Cantonment Primary School
and Hong Wen School offers a purposeful platform for social mixing and
developing 21st Century Competencies (21CC) such as communication, collaboration,
and global awareness. The experience begins with a pre-camp online meet-and-greet
to build familiarity, followed by joint camp activities and post-camp bonding
sessions that strengthen inter-school friendships and foster mutual respect,
inclusivity, and confidence to thrive in a diverse society.</p>

<h3>Art</h3>
<p>The aim of Art Education in our school is to enable every child to enjoy
art, communicate visually, and make meaning through connecting with society
and culture. Guided by the Singapore Art Curriculum Framework, our programme
nurtures students’ imagination and creativity while developing visual literacy.
Through the key domains of <em>Seeing, Expressing, and Appreciating</em>,
students learn to observe the world with sensitivity, express their ideas
confidently, and value diverse perspectives in art.</p>

<p>Art Curriculum Framework</p>
<p><strong>Core Learning Experiences</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Primary Art Drawing Experience (Primary 1 to 6)</strong>
<br>Drawing is the foundation of visual expression and communication. In our
school, all students from Primary 1 to 6 engage in a dedicated drawing
unit each year that nurtures imagination, self-confidence, and cognitive
growth. Rather than perfecting technique, the experience encourages students
to explore diverse materials and artistic processes as tools for thinking
and expression. A blended learning approach—including videos, games, and
slides on the Student Learning Space (SLS)—supports this experience and
enriches classroom learning.</p>

<p><strong>Museum-Based Learning (Primary 4)</strong>
<br>At Primary 4, students participate in Museum-Based Learning (MBL), an
authentic art experience that connects them with Singapore’s heritage through
visits to local art museums. This integrated programme includes pre-visit
preparations, hands-on exploration during the museum visit, and post-visit
reflection and creation. As both artists and audience, students develop
a deeper appreciation of local art and culture, while making connections
with Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) and Social Studies to consider
Singapore’s history through multiple perspectives.</p>

<p><strong>Exhibition in Curriculum (P1–P6)</strong>
<br>Exhibiting artwork is a key part of the artistic journey. In our school,
students regularly present their works in class, school, and community
spaces, making exhibitions a meaningful part of learning. This process
helps students understand how display settings influence artistic meaning
and builds their confidence through roles such as docents, curators, or
art reporters. As they grow, students deepen their involvement in exhibitions,
reflecting their development as both creators and communicators in the
visual arts.</p>

<h3>Music</h3>
<p>The aim of Music Education in our school is to enable students to:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Acquire and apply musical skills, knowledge and understanding through
Listening, Creating and Performing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Develop abilities for creative expression and communication</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Develop an understanding and appreciation of music in local and global
cultures</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cultivate a life-long enjoyment and involvement in music.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Aligned with the Singapore Music Curriculum Concept, our programme is
centred on the interconnected processes of <strong>Listening, Creating, and Performing</strong>,
guided by the <strong>Experience–Concept–Application (ECA)</strong> approach.
Students first engage in rich musical <strong>Experiences</strong> that reflect
the multi-dimensional nature of music practice and provide authentic contexts
for learning. Through these experiences, they explore musical <strong>Concepts</strong>—such
as elements, styles, and structures—through active <strong>Discourse</strong>.
Finally, students <strong>Apply</strong> their understanding by expressing
ideas creatively and confidently through listening tasks, music creation,
and performance opportunities. This approach nurtures their musicality,
critical thinking, and appreciation for diverse musical traditions, fostering
a deep and lasting connection with music.</p>

<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/PAM/PAM20.png">
</div>
<p>In line with our Learning for Life Programme, the annual Gems Jam is an
inclusive talent competition which encourages all students to showcase
their talents in the performing arts. Students can participate in the Lower,
Middle and Upper Primary Category by performing an instrumental piece,
sing or dance. The song composing category is open to the middle and upper
primary students to encourage original song composition which promotes
the school core values. The inter-class category encourages students to
perform as a class. All students are provided with training during Music
lessons so that students can uncover their hidden talents.</p>
