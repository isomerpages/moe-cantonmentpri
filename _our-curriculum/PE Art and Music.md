<h3>Signature Programmes</h3>
<p><strong><u>Lower Primary Games Day (Primary 1 to 2) </u></strong>
<br>The annual Lower Primary Games Day has always been the highlight for our
Primary 1 to 2 students. This is a time where every student gets the opportunity
to represent his/her class to compete with other classes in various games
and sports.</p>
<p>The stations, played in a relay style, are designed by the Physical Education
(PE) department. Each station comprises physical skills taught during PE
lessons, which is in alignment to the PE syllabus. Students will also be
able to appreciate social and emotional bonds with their classmates as
they take turns to play the games and cheer them on. In addition, they
will also demonstrate the school values such as resilience as they learn
from the successes and failures in the game practices and actual competitions.
Through this annual games day event, it is our hope that that the students
have fun and bond as a class!</p>

<p><strong><u>Upper Primary Games Day (Primary 3 to 6) </u></strong>
<br>The Upper Primary Games Day for our Primary 3 to 5 students is integrated
as part of our Children’s Day celebration every year. Whereas for the Primary
6 students, they will have their very own Games Day during post-PSLE. It
is an event that our students look forward to as it is an exciting platform
for them to showcase and apply the different skills they have learnt in
PE lessons through inter-class competitions. The games played at each level
are Football (Primary 4), Floorball (Primary 5), and Frisbee (Primary 6),
whereby they focus on the use of different equipment learnt in their PE
Lessons as well as the application of Games Concepts in the Learning Area
of Games and Sports.</p>
<p>While Games Day is a competition itself, it provides ample opportunities
for students to work and communicate with one another; build strength and
resilience; understand the importance of teamwork and enact the true meaning
of sportsmanship, fair play and respect for opponents.</p>

<p><strong><u>Primary 4 Museum Based Learning (MBL) </u></strong>
<br>From 2018, all primary school students will get to visit a museum as part
of the refreshed art education syllabus aimed to make learning more authentic
and to expose students to Singapore art. The MBL experience is designed
to provide both breadth and depth of learning local art as part of all
Primary 4 students’ core learning experience in the art curriculum.</p>
<p>The experience comprises pre-, during- and post-visit experiences to National
Gallery Singapore where students are involved as artists and audience to
create and appreciate art. MBL culminates in a showcase of students’ art
expressions that will form part of the collective memory for all Singaporean
students. There is a greater focus on visual inquiry skills – observation
and interpretation – and reflecting on artwork through activities and discussions
facilitated by the education facilitator of the museum.</p>

<p><strong><u>Primary 5 Camp </u></strong>
<br>The Primary 5 Outdoor Camp is a 3-day programme that is part of MOE’s
initiative to provide every primary school child with an outdoor experience
to promote the development of social skills, knowledge and values.</p>
<p>The camp serves as a platform for the students to integrate their learning
of the various academic subjects through the provision of outdoor experiences.
In the camp, students engage in outdoor activities, embrace diversity through
social mixing opportunities&nbsp;and develop positive Teacher-Student Relationships
via out-of-classroom interactions.</p>
