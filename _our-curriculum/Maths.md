<h3>Vision</h3>
<p>Passionate Mathematics Learner and Analytical Problem Solver</p>
<h3>Mission</h3>
<p>We seek to support students to acquire mathematical concepts and skills
through experiential learning, develop reasoning and thinking skills, and
apply them in mathematical problem-solving situations.</p>
<h3>Signature Programmes</h3>
<p><strong><u>Experiential Learning </u></strong>
<br>Student centric and vibrant learning experiences are part of our school’s
Mathematics curriculum to help students see the meaning and relevance of
what they learn. Students are provided with authentic problem-solving situations
and they work in groups to solve problems. As students explore and challenge
their own assumptions with the guidance of the teachers, students are able
to appreciate the connect between conceptual understanding and application.
Through working collaboratively, students also developed their critical
thinking skills, as well as 21st century competencies.</p>
<p>Some examples of such learning experiences include:</p>
<p>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Ratio and Shadow</strong>
</p>
<p>Students have a glimpse of what engineers or scientists experience in
their work.&nbsp; This involves making visible their thinking process followed
by questioning and discussion before reaching a solution.</p>

<p>Ancient mathematicians measure the shadows and applied ratio concept
<br>to calculate the height of the Great Pyramid.</p>

<p>Students apply&nbsp;equivalent ratio to calculate the height of the school
building.</p>

<p>&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Nets of a Milk Carton</strong>
</p>
<p>Students make connections between what they learn in theory and real-life.</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width:50%" height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/maths4.png">
</div>
<p>With the knowledge learnt about nets of solid figures, students calculated
the capacity of a milk carton.</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width:50%" height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/maths5.jpg">
</div>
<p>Students explored if the capacity is really 1 litre as stated in the packaging.</p>

<p>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Properties of shapes</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Students make use of an application enabled robotic ball to draw different
shapes.</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width:30%" height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/maths.jpg">
</div>
<p>Using the properties of the shapes students have learnt, they use the
robotic ball application on the mobile device to command the robotic ball
to draw out the shapes they are learning.

<p><strong><u>Enrichment </u></strong>
<br>Students who demonstrate potential for learning advanced mathematics are
provided the opportunities to participate in programmes to foster independence
in the students’ Mathematical thinking skills.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Excellence 2000 Programme (E2K Maths)</em> 
<br>This programme is offered to selected Primary 4 and 5 students.</p>
