### Vision
Passionate Mathematics Learner and Analytical Problem Solver

### Mission
We seek to support students to acquire mathematical concepts and skills through experiential learning, develop reasoning and thinking skills, and apply them in mathematical problem-solving situations.

### Signature Programmes

**Experiential Learning** <br>
Student centric and vibrant learning experiences are part of our school’s Mathematics curriculum to help students see the meaning and relevance of what they learn. Students are provided with authentic problem-solving situations and they work in groups to solve problems. As students explore and challenge their own assumptions with the guidance of the teachers, students are able to appreciate the connect between conceptual understanding and application.  Through working collaboratively, students also developed their critical thinking skills, as well as 21st century competencies.

Some examples of such learning experiences include:

(a)                 **Ratio and Shadow**

Students have a glimpse of what engineers or scientists experience in their work.  This involves making visible their thinking process followed by questioning and discussion before reaching a solution.

Ancient mathematicians measure the shadows and applied ratio concept to calculate the height of the Great Pyramid.

 (b)                **Nets of a Milk Carton**

Students make connections between what they learn in theory and real-life.
