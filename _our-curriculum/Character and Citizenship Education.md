### Vision

**Vision:** Citizens of good character, in service to and leading others           

**Mission:** We seek to create a safe and secure learning environment that promotes the personification of character, leadership and service for others in students.

**Philosophy:** <br>
We believe that:
* Every child has the propensity to be persons of good character;
* Every child should be given the opportunity to serve and lead others;
* The school, home and community play equally important roles in shaping the child.

### Signature Programmes
To promote the holistic development of the students through Character and Citizenship Education, we adopt a holistic approach by integrating CCE in both the academic and non-academic curriculum. To help students understand what they have experienced and internalize what they have learnt, we provide students with authentic learning experiences to engage their heads, hands and heart. Students are also guided in their critical reflections.

The CCE Curriculum is delivered through
* CCE - Form Teacher Guidance Period (FTGP),
* CCE - Mother Tongue Language (MTL),
* Cyber-Wellness (CW) lessons,
* National Education (NE) commemoration of events,
* Programme for Active Learning (PAL) for Primary 1 and 2,
* Education and Career Guidance (ECG) for Primary 3 to 6 and
* Sexuality Education (SEd) for Primary 5 and 6.

<u><strong> Values Education Programme </strong></u><br>
The Values Education programme and our 5 school values are taught explicitly using the Making Thinking Visible (MTV) routines.

<u><strong> National Education & Social Studies (NESS) </strong></u><br>
National Education launched in 1997 with the intent to instil national identity and the spirit of togetherness in our young is promoted through Social Studies (SS), Interdisciplinary Project Work (IPW), School Assembly Programmes as well as commemoration of the 4 core events. The Primary SS syllabus aims to equip students with the knowledge, skills as well as attitudes and values to make informed decisions; and enable students to communicate and work as a team in a multi-cultural and interdependent world.

<u><strong> NE Students’ Experiences: </strong></u><br>
Learning activities and programmes are customized to commemorate the 4 core NE events.

<u><strong> Total Defence Day </strong></u><br>
Total Defence Day is held on 15 February each year to commemorate the fall of Singapore to the Japanese in 1942. On this day, activities held in school aim to encourage students to play a greater role in Total Defence and to highlight ways that they can contribute so that as a nation, we are better prepared for future threats and challenges.

<u><strong> International Friendship Day </strong></u><br>

<u><strong> Racial Harmony Day </strong></u><br>
Racial Harmony Day, which is commemorated on 21 July, marks the anniversary of the 1964 race riots. On this day, students reflect on and celebrate Singapore as a harmonious society built on the rich diversity of cultures. The commemoration reminds all students that it takes collaborative effort from all of us to promote social cohesion.

<u><strong> Interdisciplinary Project Work (IPW) </strong></u><br>
IPW is an authentic learning experience for our Primary 1 to 5 students whereby they synthesize the knowledge and skills that they have learnt from various subjects and apply them in real-life situations. This learning experience also aims to help students internalise the NE Dispositions and acquire the 21st century competencies, SEL Competencies, school values and life skills to prepare them for lifelong learning and the challenges ahead.
