<h3>Vision</h3>
<p><strong>Vision:</strong>&nbsp;Citizens of good character, in service to
and leading others&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Mission:</strong>&nbsp;We seek to create a safe and secure learning
environment that promotes the personification of character, leadership
and service for others in students.</p>
<p><strong>Philosophy:</strong> 
<br>We believe that:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Every child has the propensity to be persons of good character;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Every child should be given the opportunity to serve and lead others;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The school, home and community play equally important roles in shaping
the child.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Signature Programmes</h3>
<p>To promote the holistic development of the students through Character
and Citizenship Education, we adopt a holistic approach by integrating
CCE in both the academic and non-academic curriculum. To help students
understand what they have experienced and internalize what they have learnt,
we provide students with authentic learning experiences to engage their
heads, hands and heart. Students are also guided in their critical reflections.</p>

and to highlight ways that they can contribute so that as a nation, we
are better prepared for future threats and challenges.</p>
