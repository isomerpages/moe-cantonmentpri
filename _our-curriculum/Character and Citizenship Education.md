<h4>Vision</h4>
<p>Citizens of good character, in service to and leading others&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Mission</h4>
<p>We seek to create a safe and secure learning environment that promotes
the personification of character, leadership and service for others in
students.</p>
<p>Philosophy
<br>
<br>We believe that:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Every child has the propensity to be persons of good character;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Every child should be given the opportunity to serve and lead others;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The school, home and community play equally important roles in shaping
the child.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To promote the holistic development of the students through Character
and Citizenship Education, the school adopts a holistic approach by integrating
CCE into both the academic and non-academic curriculum. We aim to provide
our students with authentic learning experiences to engage their head,
heart and hands so that they are able to understand what they have experienced
and internalize what they have learnt. Thereafter, reflection is carried
out to help them develop greater self-awareness and critical thinking.
The CCE Curriculum is delivered through</p>

<h3>Signature Programmes</h3>
<p><strong>Values Education Programme (CCE@CPS)</strong>
</p>
<p>The Values Education programme and our 5 school values are taught explicitly
using the Making Thinking Visible (MTV) routines. Customizing our <strong>CCE@CPS ~ My Journey of Character Growth</strong> serves
to provide students with opportunities and platforms to become responsible
and compassionate citizens. Our students undergo a variety of learning
experiences which help them to develop problem-solving skills and positively
impact those around them. The activity journal serves as a consolidation
of reflections for the holistic development of our students in the areas
of values, leadership, reflective learning and personal growth.</p>

<p><strong>National Education &amp; Social Studies (NE &amp; SS)</strong>
</p>
<p>National Education launched in 1997 with the intent to instil national
identity and the spirit of togetherness in our young is promoted through
Social Studies (SS), Interdisciplinary Project Work (IPW), School Assembly
Programmes as well as commemoration of the 4 core NE events; namely (1)
Total Defence Day, (2) International Friendship Day, (3) Racial Harmony
Day, (4) National Day. The Primary Social Studies (SS) syllabus aims to
equip students with the knowledge, skills as well as attitudes and values
to make informed decisions; and enable students to communicate and work
as a team in a multi-cultural and interdependent world.</p>
<p><strong>NE Students’ Experiences:</strong>
<br>Learning activities and programmes are customized to commemorate the 4
core NE events.</p>
<p><strong>Total Defence Day<br></strong>Total Defence Day is held on 15
February each year to commemorate the fall of Singapore to
<br>the Japanese in 1942. On this day, activities held in school aim to encourage
students to play a greater role in Total Defence and to highlight ways
that they can contribute so that as a nation, we are better prepared for
future threats and challenges.</p>

<p><strong>International Friendship Day</strong>
<br>International Friendship Day is celebrated in schools on the third Friday
of Term Two. This is a day dedicated to the understanding and appreciation
of Singapore's relations with her neighbours, and helps students understand
the importance of mutual respect and to maintain social cohesion in our
multi-cultural society.</p>

<p><strong>Racial Harmony Day</strong>
<br>Racial Harmony Day, which is commemorated on 21 July, marks&nbsp;the anniversary
of the 1964 race riots. On this day, students reflect on and celebrate
Singapore as a harmonious society built on the rich diversity of&nbsp;cultures.
The commemoration reminds all students that it takes collaborative effort
from all of us to promote social cohesion.</p>

<p><strong>National Day</strong>

Day.</p>

<p><strong>Interdisciplinary Project Work (IPW)</strong>
<br>IPW is an authentic learning experience for our Primary 1 to 5 students
whereby they synthesize the knowledge and skills that they have learnt
from various subjects and apply them in real-life situations. This learning
experience also aims to help students internalize citizenship dispositions
and acquire the 21st century competencies, SEL Competencies, school values
and life skills to prepare them for lifelong learning and the challenges
ahead.</p>

<p><strong>Social Studies Learning Journeys</strong>
</p>
<p>The Social Studies learning journey is an integral experiential component
in the Social Studies curriculum. It aims to deepen students’ understanding
of the nation's history, culture, and societal values through real-world
exploration and observation. By venturing beyond the classroom, students
engage with key landmarks, heritage sites, and institutions that bring
textbook concepts to life. Through guided activities, reflections, and
interactive experiences, students gain a stronger sense of national identity,
appreciate the multicultural fabric of Singapore, and develop informed
and responsible citizenship.

<br><strong>Primary 2:</strong> Tiong Bahru Heritage Trail
<br><strong>Primary 3:</strong> Geylang Serai Heritage Centre
<br><strong>Primary 4:</strong> Kreta Ayer Heritage Gallery
<br><strong>Primary 5:</strong> Indian Heritage Centre
<br><strong>Primary 6:</strong> Asian Civilisations Museum</p>

<p><strong>Primary 5 NE Show<br></strong>All Primary 5 students are strongly
encouraged to attend the NE show in July annually so that it evokes a sense
of patriotism amongst students, instill the significance of National Day
and to develop a commitment towards the nation and the community.</p>

<p><strong>Values-In Action (VIA)<br></strong>Values in Action (VIA) are
learning experiences that support students’ development as socially responsible
citizens who contribute meaningfully to the community, through the learning
and application of values, knowledge and skills.</p>
<p>Our school’s Values-In Action (VIA) projects aim to help our students:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>identify and understand community issues.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>make a difference and improve the lives of others.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>reflect on their VIA experiences, reinforce their learning and internalize
values.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>take ownership of their own learning through collectively thinking about
and proposing how they can contribute to the community.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Examples of our levels’ VIA projects involve joint-collaboration by Character-Citizenship
Education (CCE), Environmental Education Committee and external organisation
such as Pearl’s Hill Care Home where learning opportunities and platforms
are created for the students to carry out everyday responsibilities, promote
sustainability such as organic farming, creation of upcycled products and
inclusive games. &nbsp;Our Primary 6 students design and create activity
booklets for the elderly which strengthens intergenerational bonds as it
supports social interaction when our students make their visit to the Home.
&nbsp;These are some ways that our students contribute and demonstrate
their love, care and concern for the school, community and country.</p>
