<u><strong> Overview </strong></u><br>
It is our belief that valuable experiences provided in the curriculum as well as school wide programmes can bring our students with different nationalities and social backgrounds together, build relationships that are for life, promote bonds of trust and respect that will deepen our national identity. Achievements through the performing arts experiences will shift mindsets in broadening the definition of success.

<u><strong>Tier 1: </strong></u><br>
The CPS Music curriculum addresses the key requirements of the MOE Music syllabus. At the same time it is customised based on the 3”E” (Explore, Equip and Enhance) approach to ensure that it is age appropriate for our students. Our distinctive Music curriculum: 
* is values driven and has a reflective component to help our students internalise the school values;
* provides students with opportunities to think out of the box, make connections between different subjects as an innovative thinker;
* gives our students a voice as they create music and have opportunities to perform on different platforms.

Students from all levels perform or lead the school in music performances as well as compose songs and music pieces through the curriculum. In view of Covid-19, the school pressed on in providing students opportunities to perform as we believe in embracing all learners. Class and individual performances were recorded and shared during pre-assemblies, recesses, Prize-giving Day and online platforms to celebrate our students’ talents. A repository of students' performances is showcased on a regular basis on our school’s google site, ‘The Virtual Stage’, to reaffirm students of their efforts.

In building the capacity of teachers, PAVE was strategically set as one of the key learning areas in 2021 and teachers use the Professional Learning Community to infuse PAVE in the different subject disciplines. Teachers shared the lessons that they have carried out during the annual CPS Learning Festival. Students are exhilarated to experience the seamless integration of PAVE in the different subjects.
