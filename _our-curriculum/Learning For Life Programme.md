<u><strong> Overview </strong></u><br>
It is our belief that valuable experiences provided in the curriculum as well as school wide programmes can bring our students with different nationalities and social backgrounds together, build relationships that are for life, promote bonds of trust and respect that will deepen our national identity. Achievements through the performing arts experiences will shift mindsets in broadening the definition of success.

<u><strong>Tier 1: </strong></u><br>
The CPS Music curriculum addresses the key requirements of the MOE Music syllabus. At the same time it is customised based on the 3”E” (Explore, Equip and Enhance) approach to ensure that it is age appropriate for our students. Our distinctive Music curriculum: 
* is values driven and has a reflective component to help our students internalise the school values;
* provides students with opportunities to think out of the box, make connections between different subjects as an innovative thinker;
* gives our students a voice as they create music and have opportunities to perform on different platforms.
