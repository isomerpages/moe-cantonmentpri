<h3>Performing Arts for Values and Excellence (PAVE)</h3>
<h4>Vision</h4>
<p>Concerned Citizens, Innovative Thinkers, Passionate Learners</p>
<h4>Mission</h4>
<p>Our Learning for Life Programme (LLP) focusing on Music and the Performing
Arts aims to:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>develop strong school values and 21st&nbsp;century competencies in all
students,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>develop a stronger understanding of our Singapore heritage and enhance
the sense of belonging to Singapore,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>develop students’ strengths, interests and passions so as to experience
greater joy of learning.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>At our school, we believe the performing arts play a vital role in nurturing
well-rounded individuals who embody our school values of Care, Graciousness,
Integrity, Resilience, and Respect. Through PAVE, students embark on an
exciting journey where character development and artistic excellence go
hand in hand.</p>
<h4>Our Values-Driven Approach</h4>
<p><u>Opportunities for All Students</u>
</p>
<p>The artistic journey begins with regular exposure to diverse performances
during school assemblies and celebrations. These performances often carry
meaningful messages that reinforce values such as respect for different
cultures and graciousness towards others.</p>

<p>Throughout the year, our students experience the vibrant tapestry of Singapore's
cultural heritage through traditional dance, music, and drama performances
during festivals such as Chinese New Year, Hari Raya Puasa, Deepavali,
and National Day.</p>

<p>Our younger students participate in the Lower Primary Concert, where they
learn to demonstrate care and support for their peers while building resilience
through practice and preparation. Primary 6 students explore various dance
genres in their programme, developing integrity as they push themselves
to master new skills.</p>

<p>We embrace inclusivity in our programmes, welcoming talented artists with
special needs to perform and work with our students. Through these meaningful
interactions, our students develop empathy and learn to appreciate diverse
abilities in the performing arts, reinforcing our belief that the arts
are truly for everyone.</p>

<p><strong>Development Through Co-Curricular Activities (CCAs)</strong>
</p>
<p>Many of our students choose to develop their artistic talents through
our performing arts Co-Curricular Activities in Choir, Dance, and Guitar
Ensemble. These groups provide excellent platforms for building resilience
through regular practice and performance preparations. Students learn integrity
as they work towards group goals, and demonstrate graciousness in supporting
one another during performances at Teachers' Day Celebrations and Primary
One Orientation.</p>

<p><strong>Enhanced Learning Opportunities</strong>
</p>
<p>Selected students receive additional opportunities through masterclasses
with professional artists and musicians. In these sessions, they learn
the importance of respect – both for their art form and their mentors.
These students also participate in leadership development programmes where
they learn to care for and guide their peers.</p>

<p><strong>Excellence in Performance</strong>
</p>
<p>Our most talented performers represent the school at external platforms
including the prestigious Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentations.
These experiences build resilience as students learn to overcome challenges
and maintain integrity in their artistic pursuits. They demonstrate graciousness
in victory and resilience in setbacks, understanding that character excellence
is as important as artistic excellence.</p>

<p><strong>Our Impact</strong>
</p>
<p>Through PAVE, we nurture confident, creative individuals who not only
appreciate their cultural roots but also exemplify strong values in their
daily lives. From ukulele sessions to drama productions, every experience
is designed to spark curiosity and creativity while strengthening character.
