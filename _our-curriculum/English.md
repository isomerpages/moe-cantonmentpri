### Vision
Avid readers, Eloquent speakers, Inspired writers&nbsp;

### Mission

The CPS  English Department is committed to building an English classroom that will produce young communicators who can articulate their ideas well; verbally and written and to encourage a love for the language.

For our students to grow and become successful members of our society, they must have a strong foundation in the English Language. We recognise that at the primary level, it is important that our students develop mastery in their basic skills in listening, speaking, reading and writing. We shall nurture our students to develop a love for the language by recognising its power and using it responsibly.

On this learning journey, we engage our students in rich and rewarding experiences which will help them develop deeper knowledge and skills to be creative, critical and innovative thinkers.

The knowledge and skills our students learn will empower them to take responsibility for their own learning; to explore with an insatiable curiosity about the world and be life-long learners.

### Signature Programmes

<u><strong> Approach </strong></u><br>
To realise our vision, we adopt a balanced and&nbsp;integrated approach in designing the English Language (EL) curriculum for the students. We combine the use of STELLAR (STrategies for English Language Learning And Reading),&nbsp;the core programme designed by MOE curriculum specialists, with&nbsp;our school-based curriculum. Our STELLAR approach is aligned with our&nbsp;department’s education philosophy to Engage, Empower and Enable. We strongly believe this approach will develop&nbsp;students to be confident&nbsp;and competent users of the English Language.
  
<u><strong> STELLAR </strong></u><br>
The STELLAR programme aims to cultivate the love of reading as well as to build a strong language foundation.&nbsp;It involves using&nbsp;age-appropriate resources and research based teaching strategies to engage our&nbsp;students in their learning of the language.  
  
The key strategies used in the Lower Primary classrooms are as follows:

1) Reading and Viewing - Shared Book Approach (SBA) <br>
2) Writing and Representing - Guided Class Writing <br>
3) Differentiated Focus Lessons (DFLs) - Word Study <br>

The key strategies used in the Upper Primary classrooms are as follows:

1) Silent reading - Sustained Silent Reading Approach <br>
2) Reading and understanding of text - Supported Reading Approach <br>
3) Composition writing – Writing Process Cycle Approach <br>
4) Differentiated learning – Differentiated Instruction Approach <br>

<u><strong> School Based Curriculum </strong></u><br>
Apart from STELLAR, the department has also crafted a structured programme to engage, empower and enable our&nbsp;students to achieve&nbsp;success in building strong&nbsp;language skills.

<u><strong> English Language Oracy Programme </strong></u><br>
Oracy is seen as one of the essential pillars of children’s early development today. Through practicing oracy in the social context of the classroom, children are active participants in developing understanding and making knowledge and skills their own.  
  
Oracy is broadly concerned with the complex ways in which language skills, interpersonal skills and thinking skills work together and affect each other in the social context of school. It emphasizes the vital role of listening and talking&nbsp;in children’s learning. The ability to listen actively, speak clearly, communicate&nbsp;fluently, and&nbsp;engage in a&nbsp;meaningful two-way&nbsp;interaction with others is seen as a vital, integral part of the process of children’s learning and academic development in English Language.  
  
This programme is a&nbsp;5-year English Language Oracy Programme (ELOP) which provides a&nbsp;platform for&nbsp;students to:
* Appreciate the English Language through creative ways&nbsp;
* Express themselves creatively through the English Language&nbsp;
* Appreciate&nbsp;good quality works of literature.
* Work&nbsp;with&nbsp;peers to create works of literature

<u><strong> Character Alive Programme </strong></u><br>
In CPS, we celebrate&nbsp;reading in a big way. We strive to make reading fun for the&nbsp;students by having Characters come Alive during our annual English Language Week. This activity&nbsp;arouses students’ curiosity in interesting characters found in stories.&nbsp;We actively&nbsp;encourage all students&nbsp;to discover the fun in exploring the different genres of literature. Students are&nbsp;given an opportunity to dress up as a character in their favourite story&nbsp;book and have a fun-filled day.

&nbsp;<u><strong>Our Time To Enjoy Reading (OTTER) Programme </strong></u> <br>
We want our students in CPS to enjoy reading. This programme aims to provide our students with the opportunity to read books of various genres. Through book sharing, students are introduced to a variety of titles to pique their curiosity in wanting to read different texts. Apart from developing literacy skills through reading, students will also gain a deeper understanding of the world and different cultures around them.

<u><strong> Collaboration with Parents </strong></u><br>
To ensure our&nbsp;students enjoy the learning of English Language and are confident communicators in the language, we need parents’ support.&nbsp;

Parents can help your child gain proficiency by providing English language reading materials at home. Show your child that learning English is both enjoyable and useful in daily life. Provide opportunities for your child to listen, speak, read and write the language.&nbsp;

The school is always looking for avenues to build partnerships with parents to equip them with some knowledge and skills to guide their children at home. As such, the English Language Department is conducting an annual Parent Workshop as part of this effort. Targeted to specific primary level and literacy skill, we hope to share our school-based strategies for parents who are able to guide their child at home.
