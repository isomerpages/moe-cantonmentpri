<h4>Vision</h4>
<p>Avid readers, Eloquent speakers, Inspired writers&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Mission</h4>
<p>Cantonment Primary School’s English Department is committed to building
an English language classroom that will produce young communicators who
can articulate their ideas well; verbally and written and to encourage
a love for the language.</p>
<p>To ensure our students grow into successful and responsible members of
society, we believe that a strong foundation in the English language is
essential. At the primary level, we place a strong emphasis on helping
students master the fundamental skills of listening, speaking, reading,
and writing. Our goal is to cultivate a genuine love for the language,
empowering students to appreciate its power and use it responsibly.</p>
<p>Throughout their learning journey, we provide our students with enriching
and meaningful experiences that foster critical thinking, creativity, and
innovation. These experiences are designed to deepen their knowledge and
skills, preparing them to become thoughtful, independent thinkers.</p>
<p>The knowledge and skills our students acquire will empower them to take
ownership of their learning, cultivating a natural curiosity about the
world and a commitment to lifelong learning.</p>
<h4>Signature Programmes</h4>
<p><strong>School Based Curriculum</strong>
<br>In addition to the STELLAR2.0 programme, the department has developed
a structured curriculum designed to engage, empower, and enable students
to successfully build strong language skills.
<br>
</p>
<p><strong>English Language Oracy Programme</strong>
<br>Oracy is recognised as a fundamental pillar of early childhood development.
By engaging in oracy within the social context of the classroom, students
actively participate in the development of their understanding, while making
knowledge and skills their own.</p>
<p>Oracy encompasses the intricate ways in which language, interpersonal,
and thinking skills intersect and influence one another in the school environment.
It highlights the essential role of listening and speaking in children’s
learning. The ability to listen attentively, speak clearly, communicate
fluently, and engage in meaningful two-way interactions is considered a
crucial component of children’s academic development and their success
in mastering the English language.</p>
<p>This is a&nbsp;5-year Oracy Programme which provides a&nbsp;platform for&nbsp;students
to:</p>

<h4><strong>Character Alive Programme</strong></h4>
<p>At Cantonment Primary School, we place a strong emphasis on celebrating
reading. We aim to make reading an enjoyable experience for our students,
highlighted by our annual English Language Week, where we bring characters
to life. This event sparks students' curiosity about the fascinating characters
within stories or theme. We encourage all students to explore the excitement
of different literary genres. As part of the celebration, students have
the opportunity to dress up as their favorite storybook characters and
enjoy a fun-filled day of activities.</p>
<h4><strong>Our Time To Enjoy Reading (OTTER) Programme</strong></h4>
<p>At Cantonment Primary School, we are committed to fostering a love of
reading among our students. This programme offers students the opportunity
to explore books across various genres. Through book sharing sessions,
students are introduced to a diverse range of titles that ignite their
curiosity and encourage them to explore different texts. In addition to
enhancing literacy skills, this initiative also provides students with
a deeper understanding of the world and the diverse cultures that surround
them.</p>
<h4><strong>Collaboration with Parents</strong></h4>
<p>To ensure that our students not only enjoy learning the English language
but also become confident communicators, we greatly value the support of
our parents.</p>
<p>Parents can play a key role in helping their child develop proficiency
by providing access to English-language reading materials at home. By demonstrating
that learning English is both enjoyable and practical in everyday life,
parents can create opportunities for their child to listen, speak, read,
and write in English.</p>
