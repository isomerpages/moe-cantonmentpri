### Vision
Avid readers, Eloquent speakers, Inspired writers 

### Mission
The CPS English Department is committed to building an English classroom that will produce young communicators who can articulate their ideas well; verbally and written and to encourage a love for the language.

For our students to grow and become successful members of our society, they must have a strong foundation in the English Language. We recognise that at the primary level, it is important that our students develop mastery in their basic skills in listening, speaking, reading and writing. We shall nurture our students to develop a love for the language by recognising its power and using it responsibly.

On this learning journey, we engage our students in rich and rewarding experiences which will help them develop deeper knowledge and skills to be creative, critical and innovative thinkers.

The knowledge and skills our students learn will empower them to take responsibility for their own learning; to explore with an insatiable curiosity about the world and be life-long learners.

### Signature Programmes

**Approach** <br>
To realise our vision, we adopt a balanced and integrated approach in designing the English Language (EL) curriculum for the students. We combine the use of STELLAR (STrategies for English Language Learning And Reading), the core programme designed by MOE curriculum specialists, with our school-based curriculum. Our STELLAR approach is aligned with our department’s education philosophy to Engage, Empower and Enable. We strongly believe this approach will develop students to be confident and competent users of the English Language.
  
**STELLAR** <br>
The STELLAR programme aims to cultivate the love of reading as well as to build a strong language foundation. It involves using age-appropriate resources and research based teaching strategies to engage our students in their learning of the language.  
  
The key strategies used in the Lower Primary classrooms are as follows:
