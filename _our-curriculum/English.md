<h4>Vision</h4>
<p>Avid readers, Eloquent speakers, Inspired writers&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Mission</h4>
<p>Cantonment Primary School’s English Department is committed to building
an English language classroom that will produce young communicators who
can articulate their ideas well; verbally and written and to encourage
a love for the language.</p>
<p>To ensure our students grow into successful and responsible members of
society, we believe that a strong foundation in the English language is
essential. At the primary level, we place a strong emphasis on helping
students master the fundamental skills of listening, speaking, reading,
and writing. Our goal is to cultivate a genuine love for the language,
empowering students to appreciate its power and use it responsibly.</p>
<p>Throughout their learning journey, we provide our students with enriching
and meaningful experiences that foster critical thinking, creativity, and
innovation. These experiences are designed to deepen their knowledge and
skills, preparing them to become thoughtful, independent thinkers.</p>
<p>The knowledge and skills our students acquire will empower them to take
ownership of their learning, cultivating a natural curiosity about the
world and a commitment to lifelong learning.</p>
<h4>Signature Programmes</h4>
<p><strong>School Based Curriculum</strong>
<br>In addition to the STELLAR2.0 programme, the department has developed
a structured curriculum designed to engage, empower, and enable students
to successfully build strong language skills.
<br>
</p>
<p><strong>English Language Oracy Programme</strong>
<br>Oracy is recognised as a fundamental pillar of early childhood development.
By engaging in oracy within the social context of the classroom, students
actively participate in the development of their understanding, while making
knowledge and skills their own.</p>
<p>Oracy encompasses the intricate ways in which language, interpersonal,
and thinking skills intersect and influence one another in the school environment.
It highlights the essential role of listening and speaking in children’s
learning. The ability to listen attentively, speak clearly, communicate
fluently, and engage in meaningful two-way interactions is considered a
crucial component of children’s academic development and their success
in mastering the English language.</p>
<p>This is a&nbsp;5-year Oracy Programme which provides a&nbsp;platform for&nbsp;students
to:</p>
