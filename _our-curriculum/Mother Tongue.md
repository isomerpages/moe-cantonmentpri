<u><strong> Performing Arts for Values Education and Excellence (PAVE) </strong></u><br>
In line with our school’s Learning for Life Programme (PAVE), drama is used as a pedagogy for Primary 1 to 6 students. The Primary 1 and 2 students go through an introduction to drama for 2 weeks during the Mother Tongue fortnight week. From Primary 3 onwards, drama is infused into the teaching of selected comprehension/composition lessons. This personification of the characters also allows students the opportunity to examine the texts/pictures at a deeper level. Additionally, songs are incorporated into the curriculum to promote the joy of learning in MTL.

<u><strong> MTL Fortnight and Cultural Camp </strong></u><br>
MTL fortnight and Cultural Camp aims to provide an authentic learning opportunity for students to understand and appreciate Mother Tongue culture, to heighten the use of mother tongue languages beyond the classrooms and to develop our students’ interest in the learning of the language. Fortnightly activities are conducted collaboratively amongst the CL, ML and TL departments. Students are given the exposure to cultures of the various ethnic groups.

Students’ learning is deepened as students use ICT regularly in the MTL lessons. In developing our students to be self-directed learners, SLS lesson packages and ICT tools are used at all levels and regularly to enthuse students and to increase engagement.

<u><strong> Conversational Chinese/Malay Programme (CCM) </strong></u><br>
The Conversational Chinese and Malay Programme (CCM) has been a MOE initiated programme since 2005. The school offers this programme to Primary 3 and Primary 4 students who are interested. This programme aims to help students communicate (listen and speak) in everyday situations using the MTLs and to understand and respond to conversations or verbal narratives on selected issues. Through the programme, Primary 3 and Primary 4 students are able to communicate effectively with their counterparts, and to better understand and appreciate Chinese / Malay culture and values and enhance their rapport with Chinese / Malay-speaking friends.
