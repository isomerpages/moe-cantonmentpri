<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>nurture students to be confident and effective communicators in the Mother
Tongue Languages (MTL).</p>
</li>

<p>support students in appreciating the rich cultural heritage of the Chinese,
Malay, and Indian (Tamil) communities through their MTL.</p>
</li>

<p>instill the joy of learning the MTL through authentic and engaging approaches.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Signature Programmes</h4>
<p><strong>Performing Arts for Values Education and Excellence (PAVE) </strong>
<br>At Cantonment Primary School, learning Mother Tongue Languages is an exciting
adventure filled with drama, stories, and songs!</p>
<p>Our little stars in Primary 1 and 2 kick off their journey with an introduction
to drama during our Mother Tongue Fortnight. Watch their eyes light up
as they take their first steps into the wonderful world of dramatic expression!</p>
<p>As our students progress to Primary 3 and beyond, the magic continues!
Through creative dramatisation, our students dive deep into comprehension
and composition lessons, bringing texts and pictures to life in ways that
textbooks alone never could.</p>
<p>There is also a musical twist to our Mother Tongue Languages lessons.
Our students embrace language learning through music and movement.</p>
<p>Through our unique PAVE programme, we are not just teaching language –we
are nurturing confident communicators and creative thinkers who truly love
learning their Mother Tongue Languages!</p>
