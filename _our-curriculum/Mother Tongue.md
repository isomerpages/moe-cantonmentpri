**Performing Arts for Values Education and Excellence (PAVE)** <br>
In line with our school’s Learning for Life Programme (PAVE), drama is used as a pedagogy for Primary 1 to 6 students. The Primary 1 and 2 students go through an introduction to drama for 2 weeks during the Mother Tongue fortnight week. From Primary 3 onwards, drama is infused into the teaching of selected comprehension/composition lessons. This personification of the characters also allows students the opportunity to examine the texts/pictures at a deeper level. Additionally, songs are incorporated into the curriculum to promote the joy of learning in MTL.

**MTL Fortnight and Cultural Camp** <br>
MTL fortnight and Cultural Camp aims to provide an authentic learning opportunity for students to understand and appreciate Mother Tongue culture, to heighten the use of mother tongue languages beyond the classrooms and to develop our students’ interest in the learning of the language. Fortnightly activities are conducted collaboratively amongst the CL, ML and TL departments. Students are given the exposure to cultures of the various ethnic groups.

Students’ learning is deepened as students use ICT regularly in the MTL lessons. In developing our students to be self-directed learners, SLS lesson packages and ICT tools are used at all levels and regularly to enthuse students and to increase engagement.
