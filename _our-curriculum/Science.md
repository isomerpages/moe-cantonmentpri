**Mushroom & Vegetable Growing** <br>
The Science teachers believe that students learn best through doing. Thus, teachers provide students ample opportunities to learn Science through hands-on learning opportunities such as mushroom growing (Primary 3), vegetable growing using soil-based techniques (Primary 3) and vegetable growing using hydroponics (Primary 4). Through these programmes, students also learn about the importance of healthy eating habits, reducing food waste and food security in Singapore.
