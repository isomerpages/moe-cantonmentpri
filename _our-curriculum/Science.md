<p><strong>Mushroom &amp; Vegetable Growing </strong>
<br>The Science teachers believe that students learn best through doing. Thus,
teachers provide students ample opportunities to learn Science through
hands-on learning opportunities such as mushroom growing (Primary 3), Herbs
growing using soil-based techniques (Primary 3) and vegetable growing using
hydroponics (Primary 4). Through these programmes, students also learn
about the importance of healthy eating habits, reducing food waste and
food security in Singapore.</p>
