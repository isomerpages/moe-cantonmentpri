<h4>Vision</h4>
<p>To nurture creative, passionate and active citizens with a passion for
sports and an appreciation for the arts.</p>
<h4>Mission</h4>
<p>Every student develops holistically through authentic and meaningful learning
experiences in CCA.</p>
<h4>Rationale and Policy Guidelines</h4>
<p><strong>Co-Curricular Activities (CCA) play a key role in our students’ holistic development.</strong>
<br>In our school, we offer a diverse range of CCAs to cater to the interests,
strengths, and passions of our students. Beyond skill acquisition, our
CCA programme seeks to nurture values such as teamwork, integrity, and
the pursuit of excellence. Through shared experiences with fellow students,
students also develop camaraderie and learn positive social behaviours.
<br>
<br>We strongly encourage every student to participate. We believe CCAs provide
rich opportunities to cultivate the <em>7 Habits of the Leader in Me</em>,
instill strong values, and equip our students with the competencies needed
to thrive in the 21st century.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Each student is allowed to join one CCA per year, as active participation
requires consistent effort and commitment. Our school seeks to ensure students
are able to strike a healthy balance between their academic responsibilities
and CCA involvement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Students will be given up to six CCA choices, typically when they are
in Primary 3, and are required to indicate their order of preference of
their CCA and preferred categories. The school will allocate CCAs based
on students’ preferences and subject to availability while ensuring placement
within the preferred category. If a student’s top-choice CCA is full, they
will be considered for their next preferred option.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once successfully registered, students are expected to remain committed
to their assigned CCA for the full CCA calendar year.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A student may request a CCA transfer form from their current CCA teacher-in-charge
if they wish to transfer to another CCA in Primary 4, subjected to final
approval from the HOD CCA.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each CCA will run for approximately 30 sessions per year. Students preparing
for competitions or showcases may be required to attend additional sessions,
such as twice-weekly training during peak seasons.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a student is unable to attend a CCA session, parents should inform
the respective CCA teacher via email, WhatsApp, a written letter, or by
submitting a medical certificate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Students are to bring their CCA attire (e.g. Cub Scout uniform, school
team jersey) in their school bags and change into it only during break
after FTGP lessons. They are not permitted to wear their CCA attire for
the entire school day unless &nbsp;permission has been granted (e.g. wearing
the Cub Scout uniform for Scouts Founder’s Day).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Objectives</h4>
<p>The CCA Programme provides students with meaningful opportunities to discover
their interests and develop their talents. It aims to nurture a life-long
passion—whether in sports, the arts, or clubs or uniformed groups—that
supports personal growth beyond the classroom. Through sustained participation,
students learn to lead balanced and fulfilling lives, carrying these positive
habits and pursuits into adulthood.</p>
<h4>Schedule and CCA Teachers in-charge</h4>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>All CCAs are held on Tuesdays from 3.30 p.m. to 5.30 p.m. Any additional
sessions will be communicated in advance by the respective CCA teachers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As staff deployment, schedules (including days, venues, and timings),
and CCA offerings are subject to change, parents will receive an updated
copy of the CCA schedule at the start of each calendar year.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h4>External CCA</h4>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>For sports not offered as CCAs but represented at National School Games
(e.g. Gymnastics, Swimming, Taekwondo, Track &amp; Field), students and
parents are expected to take initiative in understanding the competition
requirements—this includes discussing with their external coaches, referring
to the NSG website, and being familiar with event categories and rules.
Parents who wish for their child to represent the school in such events
must submit an indication of interest via <a href="https://go.gov.sg/cpsnsg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">go.gov.sg/cpsnsg</a> at least seven working
days before the organiser’s registration deadline.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The school will require supporting documents to verify the student’s competency
in the sport (e.g. swimming or running timings, grading cards, handicap
records, club and coach details). The school reserves the right to request
additional documentation and/or conduct selection trials before confirming
participation.</p>
