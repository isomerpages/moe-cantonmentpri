<h3>Vision</h3>
<p>Responsible, Innovative and Competent users of ICT</p>
<h3>Signature Programmes</h3>
<p><strong><u>Baseline ICT Standards and New Media Literacies </u></strong>
<br>Our ICT programmes are aligned to MOE’s direction of Student-Centric and
Values-Driven education and our school’s vision of Concerned Citizens,
Innovative Thinkers, Passionate Learners. ICT is integrated in the curriculum
across all subjects and students use ICT tools for collaborative and self-directed
learning.</p>
<p>The Baseline ICT Standards and New Media Literacies (NML) is a set of
ICT and literacy skills that our students will learn over their 6 years
in Cantonment Primary School. The Baseline ICT Standards define the basic
level of knowledge, skills and values that our students need in order to
fully benefit from a curriculum enriched with ICT, and eventually thrive
in a technology-driven society while the New Media Literacies (NML) define
the skills, knowledge, attitudes and values that students should apply
and demonstrate when harnessing technologies for learning.</p>
<p>NML are woven into all lessons at different levels progessively. Our Primary
1 to Primary 6 students are taught how to Curate, Create and Connect. For
example, our Primary 1 students will learn touch typing skills. Moving
on, they will also learn basic digital navigation skills and apply these
skills to locate, collect and sort information (Curate).&nbsp; At the Primary
2, our students learn a higher level of touch typing skills and create
a short document using Microsoft Word (Create).</p>

<p><strong><u>Cyber Wellness </u></strong>
<br>Cyber Wellness (CW) in Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) focuses
on the well-being of our students as they navigate cyberspace. Our curriculum
aims to equip students with the knowledge and skills to harness the power
of ICT for positive purposes, maintain a positive presence in cyberspace
and be safe and responsible users of ICT.</p>
<p><strong><u>MOE Cyber Wellness Framework </u></strong>
<br>The school adopts MOE’s Cyber Wellness Framework in educating our students
on Cyber Wellness. This framework focuses on three key processes: Sense,
Think and Act.</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width:80%" height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/ICT%2004.png">
</div>
<p>MOE uses the CW framework to develop the child’s instinct to protect and
empower him to take responsibility for his own well-being in cyberspace.
The three principles, ‘Respect for Self and Others’, ‘Safe and Responsible
Use’ and ‘Positive Peer Influence’ when adhered to will anchor a child’s
well-being in cyberspace as he/she will then be able to make careful and
well-considered decisions.</p>
<p><strong><u>Principles </u></strong>
<br>a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Respect for Self and Others
<br>Students need to:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>uphold their own dignity when online (e.g., share appropriate content
and participate in only legal online activities)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>respect other people online (e.g., put themselves in others’ shoes, accept
diverse views and opinions, give credit when using other people’s work
and seek permission where necessary, avoid sharing hurtful materials)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Safe and Responsible Use
<br>Students need to:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>have an understanding of the risks of harmful and illegal online behaviour,
and take steps to protect themselves (e.g., keep their personal information
private, verify the reliability of information using various sources, take
steps to avoid dangers they may encounter online)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>make wise and healthy choices (e.g., maintain a healthy balance of their
online and offline activities)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Positive Peer Influence
<br>Students need to:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>be a positive role model online (e.g., share healthy and positive content,
harness the affordances of technology to do good for society)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>advocate positive online behaviour (e.g., stand up for their peers online,
report cases of cyber bullying to a trusted adult/authority, post encouraging
remarks on social media)</p>
