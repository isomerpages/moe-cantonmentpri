### Vision

Responsible, Innovative and Competent users of ICT

### Signature Programmes

<u><strong> Baseline ICT Standards and New Media Literacies </strong></u><br>
Our ICT programmes are aligned to MOE’s direction of Student-Centric and Values-Driven education and our school’s vision of Concerned Citizens, Innovative Thinkers, Passionate Learners. ICT is integrated in the curriculum across all subjects and students use ICT tools for collaborative and self-directed learning.

The Baseline ICT Standards and New Media Literacies (NML) is a set of ICT and literacy skills that our students will learn over their 6 years in Cantonment Primary School. The Baseline ICT Standards define the basic level of knowledge, skills and values that our students need in order to fully benefit from a curriculum enriched with ICT, and eventually thrive in a technology-driven society while the New Media Literacies (NML) define the skills, knowledge, attitudes and values that students should apply and demonstrate when harnessing technologies for learning.

NML are woven into all lessons at different levels progessively. Our Primary 1 to Primary 6 students are taught how to Curate, Create and Connect. For example, our Primary 1 students will learn touch typing skills. Moving on, they will also learn basic digital navigation skills and apply these skills to locate, collect and sort information (Curate).  At the Primary 2, our students learn a higher level of touch typing skills and create a short document using Microsoft Word (Create).
