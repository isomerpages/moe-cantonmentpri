### Vision

Responsible, Innovative and Competent users of ICT

### Signature Programmes

<u><strong> Baseline ICT Standards and New Media Literacies </strong></u><br>
Our ICT programmes are aligned to MOE’s direction of Student-Centric and Values-Driven education and our school’s vision of Concerned Citizens, Innovative Thinkers, Passionate Learners. ICT is integrated in the curriculum across all subjects and students use ICT tools for collaborative and self-directed learning.

The Baseline ICT Standards and New Media Literacies (NML) is a set of ICT and literacy skills that our students will learn over their 6 years in Cantonment Primary School. The Baseline ICT Standards define the basic level of knowledge, skills and values that our students need in order to fully benefit from a curriculum enriched with ICT, and eventually thrive in a technology-driven society while the New Media Literacies (NML) define the skills, knowledge, attitudes and values that students should apply and demonstrate when harnessing technologies for learning.

NML are woven into all lessons at different levels progessively. Our Primary 1 to Primary 6 students are taught how to Curate, Create and Connect. For example, our Primary 1 students will learn touch typing skills. Moving on, they will also learn basic digital navigation skills and apply these skills to locate, collect and sort information (Curate).  At the Primary 2, our students learn a higher level of touch typing skills and create a short document using Microsoft Word (Create).

<u><strong> Cyber Wellness </strong></u><br>
Cyber Wellness (CW) in Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) focuses on the well-being of our students as they navigate cyberspace. Our curriculum aims to equip students with the knowledge and skills to harness the power of ICT for positive purposes, maintain a positive presence in cyberspace and be safe and responsible users of ICT.

<u><strong> MOE Cyber Wellness Framework </strong></u><br>
The school adopts MOE’s Cyber Wellness Framework in educating our students on Cyber Wellness. This framework focuses on three key processes: Sense, Think and Act.

MOE uses the CW framework to develop the child’s instinct to protect and empower him to take responsibility for his own well-being in cyberspace. The three principles, ‘Respect for Self and Others’, ‘Safe and Responsible Use’ and ‘Positive Peer Influence’ when adhered to will anchor a child’s well-being in cyberspace as he/she will then be able to make careful and well-considered decisions.  

<u><strong> Principles </strong></u><br>
a)       Respect for Self and Others <br>
Students need to:
* uphold their own dignity when online (e.g., share appropriate content and participate in only legal online activities)
* respect other people online (e.g., put themselves in others’ shoes, accept diverse views and opinions, give credit when using other people’s work and seek permission where necessary, avoid sharing hurtful materials)

b)      Safe and Responsible Use <br>
Students need to:  
* have an understanding of the risks of harmful and illegal online behaviour, and take steps to protect themselves (e.g., keep their personal information private, verify the reliability of information using various sources, take steps to avoid dangers they may encounter online)
* make wise and healthy choices (e.g., maintain a healthy balance of their online and offline activities)

c)       Positive Peer Influence <br>
Students need to:  
* be a positive role model online (e.g., share healthy and positive content, harness the affordances of technology to do good for society)
* advocate positive online behaviour (e.g., stand up for their peers online, report cases of cyber bullying to a trusted adult/authority, post encouraging remarks on social media)

Guided by MOE’s Cyber Wellness Framework, our school values are aligned to cyber wellness principles and taught to the students
