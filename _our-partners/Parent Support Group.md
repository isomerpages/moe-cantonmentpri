<u><strong> Dialogue Sessions with School Leaders </strong></u><br>
Dialogue sessions with School Leaders are organised to foster a better understanding between school management and parents. During these sessions, the School Leaders share the rationale behind key programmes or changes in the school and how parents may support their children at home to ensure learning continues beyond the classroom. It offers platforms for SLs to hear the voices of parents too.

<u><strong> Parenting Workshops </strong></u><br>
Parenting workshops are organised to support parents as they support their children through the various stages in their primary school learning journey. Parents form networks to learn good practices and gather advice from other parents as well as to provide emotional support for one another.

<u><strong> Parent Volunteers </strong></u><br>
Parent volunteers support the running of events, programmes and committees in the school such as Earth Week, International Friendship Day, English Week and Environment Education Committee. Parents work with the school to prepare videos, organise assembly programmes, career talks and support leadership training and learning journeys organised by the school.
