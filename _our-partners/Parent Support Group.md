<p><strong><u>Dialogue Sessions with School Leaders </u></strong>
<br>Dialogue sessions with School Leaders are organised to foster a better
understanding between school management and parents. During these sessions,
the School Leaders share the rationale behind key programmes or changes
in the school and how parents may support their children at home to ensure
learning continues beyond the classroom. It offers platforms for SLs to
hear the voices of parents too.</p>
<p><strong><u>Parenting Workshops </u></strong>
<br>Parenting workshops are organised to support parents as they support their
children through the various stages in their primary school learning journey.
Parents form networks to learn good practices and gather advice from other
parents as well as to provide emotional support for one another.</p>
<p><strong><u>Parent Volunteers </u></strong>
<br>Parent volunteers support the running of events, programmes and committees
in the school such as Earth Week, International Friendship Day, English
Week and Environment Education Committee. Parents work with the school
to prepare videos, organise assembly programmes, career talks and support
leadership training and learning journeys organised by the school.</p>
